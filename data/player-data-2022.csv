Turner's excellence depends on his health. He's played more than 148 games only once in his seven-year career. If LA's great weather can keep him on the field, he's a legitimate threat for 30 HRs, 100 RBI and 110 runs in a consistently good Dodgers lineup. But Turner's history makes it more likely he plays in something closer to 120-130 games. Is that worth his top-three ADP? Qualifying at 2B bumps up his value a few ticks, but keeper league owners should beware: He'll return to SS-only eligibility in 2023.",,2022
2,Juan Soto,WSH,OF,2.0,2.0,Juan Soto (WSH - OF),567,.318|114R|34HR|106RBI|12SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/juan-soto.php,Soto,".318|114R|34HR|106RBI|12SB
Ahh, the Juan Soto conundrum. Soto is one of the best hitters in baseball. At 23 years old, he's on a Hall of Fame trajectory. His raw power is astounding. But he plays for the suddenly terrible and powerless Washington Nationals. A few years removed from the World Series, the team is now a collection of ""That guy is still playing?"" and ""Never heard of him"" types. Soto's HR numbers will be huge, but his R and RBI numbers will take a big hit.",,2022
3,Jose Ramirez,CLE,3B,3.0,3.0,Jose Ramirez (CLE - 3B),513,.275|102R|35HR|104RBI|25SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/jose-ramirez.php,Ramirez,".275|102R|35HR|104RBI|25SB
Ramirez continues to be one of fantasy baseball's most bankable commodities, reliably stuffing the stat sheet. His fire-hydrant physique belies impressive speed; he swiped 27 bags last year, including 18 after the All-Star Break. The power numbers are stable. The batting average has been less predictable, but it's probably a good sign that he managed to bat .266 last year despite a .256 BABIP. His supporting cast isn't great, but it wasn't great last year either, and he still scored 111 runs and had 103 RBI. Invest with confidence.",,2022

The young slugger put it all together in 2021, tying for the MLB lead in HRs and leading the AL in runs, OBP and slugging percentage in his age-22 season. Statcast numbers and other peripherals fully supported the gaudy surface stats. Guerrero alleviated concerns that he hit the ball on the ground too much by cutting his ground-ball rate from 55% to 44%. Vladito doesn't steal bases, but he gives you everything else. And unlike his famous dad, he's actually willing to take a walk. Guerrero deserves to be taken in the top half of the first round.",,2022
5,Bo Bichette,TOR,SS,5.0,5.0,Bo Bichette (TOR - SS),433,.293|105R|28HR|94RBI|21SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/bo-bichette.php,Bichette,".293|105R|28HR|94RBI|21SB
The future is bright for this young star as he enters his age-24 season. Bichette broke out in 2021 with an AL-high 191 hits and proved himself to be a true five-category performer. His dad Dante once hit 40 HRs for the Rockies, and Bo seemingly has room for growth in the power department with some launch-angle adjustments, since his ground ball rate last season was just shy of 50%. Bichette doesn't like to take walks, but he hits the ball hard to all fields. Playing in one of MLB's best lineups should help keep his run and RBI totals robust. His 2021 season will be a tough act to follow, but this is a first-round profile.",,2022
6,Bryce Harper,PHI,OF,6.0,7.0,Bryce Harper (PHI - OF),478,.288|105R|37HR|101RBI|14SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/bryce-harper.php,Harper,".288|105R|37HR|101RBI|14SB
Mr. Consistency. Draft Harper somewhere between 6 and 10 in the first round, leave him in the lineup and count your blessings. In one of the quietest MVP campaigns in recent memory, Harper did Harper-like things in 2021, with 35 homers, 101 runs, 84 RBI and 13 stolen bases. Expect the Phillies to take a swing at upgrading their roster in at least three spots: OF, SS and 3B. If that happens, a 100 RBI season with 110 runs would be Harper's floor.",,2022

Consistency and durability make Cole the most bankable starting pitcher in fantasy baseball. He ranked third in MLB in strikeouts (243) last season and tied for third in wins (16). The last time Cole made fewer than 30 starts in a full season was 2016. His 3.23 ERA and 1.06 WHIP last season were actually high by his standards - his worst numbers in those categories since 2017 - which illustrates just how brilliant he's been in recent years. Cole had an ERA above 4.00 after the All-Star break last season, but his 0.51 ERA in three August starts leaves the impression that his second-half ups and downs were random variance. This is an ace at the height of his powers and a worthy first-round pick.",,2022
8,Corbin Burnes,MIL,SP,8.0,9.0,Corbin Burnes (MIL - SP),469,13-6-0SV|3.05|1.06|11.60K9,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/corbin-burnes.php,Burnes,"13-6-0SV|3.05|1.06|11.60K9
Why are you even reading this? If you're a fantasy manager who likes to draft starting pitchers in the first round and Burnes is there, you grab him. If he falls to the second round, you grab him. If he falls to the third, you're probably playing fantasy football, and he's probably a better QB than Carson Wentz, so grab him. Burnes won the Cy Young last year and there's nothing in any of his stat projections that show any reason for concern. He's got overall SP1 capabilities. Don't overthink it.",,2022
9,Mookie Betts,LAD,OF,9.0,12.0,Mookie Betts (LAD - OF),483,.284|116R|30HR|83RBI|16SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/mookie-betts.php,Betts,".284|116R|30HR|83RBI|16SB
If Betts is healthy, he's an automatic NL MVP candidate. He played through back and hip injuries last year that limited his effectiveness. Reports are that Betts is healthy and ready to resume his spot amongst the game's elite. If he has 2B eligibility in your league, he's even more valuable. If Betts slides to 8, 9, 10 in the first round, snatch him up. If he adds 20 steals to his usually impressive R/HR/RBI tallies, he's going to be in the running for the overall No. 1 player at season's end.",,2022
10,Mike Trout,LAA,OF,10.0,10.0,Mike Trout (LAA - OF),448,.290|101R|37HR|97RBI|8SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/mike-trout.php,Trout,".290|101R|37HR|97RBI|8SB
He's destined to end up in Cooperstown, but Trout has been plagued by injuries in what should be the prime of his career. He hasn't played more than 140 games in a season since 2016, and a calf injury last year limited him to just 117 at-bats. If he can stay healthy, he'll hit a bunch of bombs and make major contributions in runs, RBI and batting average. Trout once stole 49 bases, but that was a long time ago, and the SBs might not come back now that he's in his 30s. You're bound to get an injury discount on Trout, and with good reason - the risk of continued health problems is very real. But if you're lucky enough to get 150+ games out of him, you're going to turn a big profit.",,2022
11,Kyle Tucker,HOU,OF,11.0,13.0,Kyle Tucker (HOU - OF),436,.283|89R|31HR|96RBI|17SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/kyle-tucker.php,Tucker,".283|89R|31HR|96RBI|17SB
This former uber-prospect didn't disappoint in his first full MLB season, delivering the goods in five categories. There's room for more, as Tucker played 140 games and was typically slotted in the bottom half of the Astros' batting order. Tucker's contact rate is on the rise, he makes plenty of hard contact, and his flyball rate is what you're looking for in a power hitter. Tucker will probably never bee among the stolen base leaders, but he swiped 14 bags last year and has 20 SB upside. Tucker might just be scratching the surface of his talents. He figures to go somewhere close to the first-round/second-round turn, but he's destined to be a perennial first-rounder.",,2022
12,Freddie Freeman,LAD,1B,12.0,15.0,Freddie Freeman (LAD - 1B),493,.304|107R|31HR|102RBI|7SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/freddie-freeman.php,Freeman,".304|107R|31HR|102RBI|7SB
Freeman has yet to land with a new team, but we know he's not going back to the Braves, who traded for first baseman Matt Olson. If Freeman ends up on a team like the Yankees or Red Sox, 100/35/125/.305 isn't out of the question. If he ends up in a big ballpark, how will that impact the 32-year-old. Freeman is normally a surefire top-25 pick, but fantasy managers may have to be more cautious with the lefty this year.",,2022
13,Ronald Acuna Jr.,ATL,OF,13.0,8.0,Ronald Acuna Jr. (ATL - OF),422,.286|108R|36HR|82RBI|23SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/ronald-acuna.php,Acuna Jr.,".286|108R|36HR|82RBI|23SB
In any other year, Acuna, Jr. is an easy top-five pick. The five-category star is a set-it-and-forget-it roster heavyweight. But coming off a gruesome mid-summer ACL tear, there's no guarantee he'll be ready for the start of the season. Even if he is, Acuna is unlikely to wreak havoc on the basepaths for the first couple months. Throw in the gaping hole behind him in the lineup if the Braves don't re-sign Freddie Freeman and the normally sure-thing Acuna comes into 2022 with more questions than a Jeopardy episode.",,2022
14,Rafael Devers,BOS,3B,14.0,16.0,Rafael Devers (BOS - 3B),448,.284|101R|36HR|106RBI|5SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/rafael-devers.php,Devers,".284|101R|36HR|106RBI|5SB
Devers hit a career-high 38 HRs in 2021, and the peripherals say there's more where that came from. He was north of the 90th percentile in average exit velocity, maximum exit velocity and hard hit percentage. Devers doesn't take a lot of walks, but he drives the ball to all fields with authority and should provide a plus batting average. He doesn't run much, but with this sort of hitting profile, that's a minor complaint. He plays in a great hitter's park and has a strong supporting cast. Devers is building an impressive body of work, and he's still only 25. This is a rock-solid investment.",,2022

Eventually, his arm is just going to fall off, right? He's going to throw his 9 millionth inning, strike a guy out, remove his limb like something out of ""Total Recall,"" put it on the mound and walk away into the sunset. Seems plausible, because there's no way that arm isn't bionic. The 37-year-old signed a three-year deal to return to the NL East and lead the Mets' rotation. He should be a lock for 200 IP and 250+ Ks. And his new home, Citi Field, is one of the most pitching-friendly parks in baseball. Scherzer probably isn't going to keep an ERA below 2.50, but somewhere around 2.70-2.80 will still make managers smile.",,2022

Save some time. Go back and read what we wrote about Fernando Tatis Jr. and apply it to deGrom. The Mets' ace is a legit superstar ... when he plays. With what is shaping up to be a shortened spring training, trusting a 33-year-old coming off multiple injuries to his shoulder and UCL seems ... optimistic. If he throws 180+ innings, he'll deliver a sub 2.50 ERA, with piles of strikeouts and a miniscule WHIP. But his projected WHIP may be the only thing smaller than his chances of playing a full season.",,2022

9-6-0SV|3.60|1.15|10.32K9
He's Japan's greatest gift to MLB since Ichiro, and he offers the greatest combination of hitting and pitching since Babe Ruth. Ohtani's 9.1 WAR in 2021 was more than a full win higher than anyone else's. It's unfortunate that the rules in most fantasy leagues make it impossible for investors to fully tap all of Ohtani's skills. As a hitter, he provides prodigious power, scores runs in bunches and makes meaningful SB contributions. He batted .257 last year, but would it shock anyone if he gave us a .300 season? As a pitcher, Ohtani got his walks under control, struck out 10.8 batters per nine innings, and posted a 9-2 record. It's a dazzling skill set, and if Ohtani stays healthy, he's likely to return something close to first-round value as a hitter. He's a valuable pitcher, too, but to most fantasy owners that's just gravy.",,2022

The young White Sox slugger missed more than three months after straining his hip flexor trying to leg out an infield single but went nuclear upon his return, batting .350 with 12 HRs and 35 RBI over his final 43 games. Robert runs, too, with 15 SBs in 124 career games. There's legitimate 30-30 potential here, and it's not hard to imagine Robert producing a 40 HR season at cozy Guaranteed Rate Field. A ridiculous .394 BABIP fueled last year's .338 batting average, so there's bound to be some major recoil in that category. Health is a concern as well, as Robert experienced leg tightness in the playoffs. There's a lot to like here, but a second-round ADP seems a bit rich for a 24-year-old who has yet to play a full season.",,2022

Ignoring the COVID-shortened 2020 season, Albies stands alone as the only player to score 100 runs, hit 20 home runs and steal 10 bases over each of the last three full seasons. He's a surefire five-category hitter coming into his prime. If Mookie Betts doesn't maintain 2B eligibility in your league, Albies is the No. 2 2B behind Trea Turner. His stock goes up if the Braves and Freddie Freeman come to an agreement, but even without the veteran slugger hitting behind him, Albies is a superstar.",,2022

The West Coast bias rears its ugly head again. If the Dodgers' ace pitched in Boston, New York or Chicago, headlines would call him Cy Buehler. If you play in a QS league, Walker is as sure a thing as a traffic jam on the 405. He went six or more innings in all but one of his first 27 starts last year. He'll give you a strikeout an inning, a sub-1.00 WHIP and have you feeling calm, cool and collected as a manager every fifth night. Pitching for a great Dodgers team, Buehler could top 20 wins.",,2022

It's going to be awfully hard to score on the Brewers this summer. Woodruff is a Cy Young candidate. His rotation mate Corbin Burnes won the award last year and could again this year. Don't be scared off by Woodruff's miniscule win totals from last season. He only won nine games due to the worst run support in the National League. Had he received the top-15 run support that Burnes had, Woodruff could have easily eclipsed 15 victories. He's projected for a fourth straight season of outstanding K, ERA and WHIP stats. If you can somehow pair Burnes with Woodruff early, you may not need to grab another starting pitcher before the 10th round.",,2022

It's a shame you don't get points for defense in fantasy baseball, as that would bolster Machado's falling stock. The former perennial top-10 selection is now going in the late second or early third round. Machado will turn 30 this year, and some positive regression seems to be in order. He's still a five-category contributor, and in a loaded Padres lineup, 80/25/80 with 10 SBs should be on the table. But expecting Machado to return to the 35 HR level would be downright delusional.",,2022

Speed kills. Or at least it does outside of the Big Apple. The Mets haven't had a player swipe 30 or more bases in the last seven seasons. Will they let their big free agent acquisition loose on the basepaths? Even if they do, at 34, will Marte still be an elite bag thief? If he's not running, Marte is a fantasy liability relative to his ADP. He's unlikely to pass the 20-dinger threshold, he's only had one season with 90 or more runs in his career, he's unlikely to equal last year's .372 BABIP, and he's part of the Mets' continually anemic offense. Don't overpay. But if he falls, snatch him up.",,2022

Power is his calling card, and Alvarez didn't disappoint in that department last year, mashing 33 HRs with 104 RBI. He had a healthy .277 batting average in 2021 and has a career mark of .290, so the power doesn't come at the expense of BA. The power peripherals are outstanding - he's in the 97th percentile in average exit velocity, maximum exit velocity and hard hit percentage. There could be a 50 HR season lurking here. Alvarez has just one SB in 233 career games, and he's had surgery on both knees. But if those granddad knees hold up, you're likely to be please with your return on investment.",,2022

Bieber had a breakout season in 2019, won the Cy Young Award in 2020, and was off to a good start in 2021 before a shoulder strain in mid-June landed him on IL and limited him to just two more starts the rest of the way. Bieber has some of the filthiest breaking stuff in baseball. When he's on, he piles up strikeouts and limits walks and flyballs. Shoulder problems for pitchers are worrisome, but Bieber recently told a Cleveland beat writer he feels great. There's an element of risk here, but it's injury risk, not performance risk. Bieber should continue to be a top starter if he can stay healthy.",,2022

All rise! His Honor enjoyed a season of reasonably good health in 2021 and posted a career-high .269 BA to go along with 39 HRs, 98 RBI and 89 runs. His 71% contact rate was the best of his career, and naturally his power peripherals were through the roof. No one punishes baseballs quite like Judge. Health is always a concern, and he doesn't run much, but the power skills should age well as this 6-7, 282-pound brute enters his 30s.",,2022

Anderson could fall out of bed and go 2-for-5. His batting averages the last three seasons: .335, .322, .309. At this point, we have to conclude that his consistently high BABIPs aren't fluky. Anderson isn't a truly elite base stealer, but he swiped 18 bags in 123 games last season and could conceivably steal 25-30 bases in a good year. Anderson has consistently been in the 17-20 home run range, so while he won't provide a lot of help in the power department, he won't hurt you either. In a loaded White Sox lineup, Anderson has a chance to score 100 runs if he can stay healthy. Anderson's ADP suggests he might slip into the fourth round of your draft. Pounce on him if he does.",,2022

It would normally make sense to be wary of a late-ish bloomer who has a breakout year at age 28. Hernandez established new career highs in basically every offensive category last year, batting .296, belting 32 HRs, driving in 116 runs, scoring 92 times and doubling his previous season high in stolen bases with 12. But the peripheral numbers back it all up. Statcast absolutely loves Hernandez, even backing up the SB breakout by putting him in the 85th percentile for sprint speed. He'll bat cleanup in a stacked Blue Jays lineup and should get ample opportunities to drive in runs. A full repeat of his 2021 numbers might be a stretch, but Hernandez should be able to come close.",,2022

The Braves' new slugger posted career highs across the board last season - 39 HRs, 111, RBI, 101 runs and a .271 BA - and as he enters his age-28 season, he should be in his prime. The elite power is here to stay, and after batting .195 in the shortened 2020 season, Olson made huge strides in his contact rate (80%) last year and batted a very respectable .271. Going from Oakland to the Braves' friendlier ballpark could spike his HR total. Olson is a worthy power anchor.",,2022

He was batting .321 at the All-Star Break last year, but a wrist injury sapped some of his mojo in the back half of the season. Bogaerts has one of the more stable skill sets in MLB. He has a .290 career average, and his run production has been remarkably stable. You can pencil in Bogaerts for 25 HRs, 90 RBI and 90 runs, and he's likely to hew pretty close to those numbers. Fenway Park and a strong lineup work in his favor. He's been so good for so long, it's hard to believe he's still in his 20s.",,2022

The city of Baltimore hasn't seen such an unexpectedly high HR total since Brady Anderson smacked 50 homers in 1996. Mullins had hit seven HRs in 374 career at-bats entering 2021. He cleared the fence 30 times last year and added 30 stolen bases for good measure. Mullins played the 2020 season with an undiagnosed case of Crohn's disease, which may have prevented us from seeing the ""real"" Cedric Mullins. Some pullback on the HR total is probably inevitable, but the speed and other plate skills should remain intact. Looks slightly overpriced at a third-round ADP.",,2022

This late bloomer has been fantasy gold for the last five years. Merrifield stole 40 bases last season at age 32. Durability is a big plus: Merrifield hasn't missed a game in the last three years. But there are some worrisome signs of slippage. His line drive rate has been steadily dropping over the last few seasons, and he hit only two home runs last season from July 1 on. Merrifield has been a terrific value for years, but it's possible he'll be slightly overpriced in 2022 drafts.",,2022

Semien's 45 HRs last season were the most ever by a second baseman. His monster 2021 performance also included 115 runs, 102 RBI and 15 stolen bases. A 48% flyball rate makes Semien a launch angle darling and suggests that he'll keep clearing the fences. He's been a prolific run scorer for the last four seasons. On the other hand, there's some batting average risk here, and Semien probably maxed out his SB potential last year. He's going from a loaded Blue Jays lineup to a sketchy Rangers lineup, and Semien will turn 32 in September. Last year's numbers will make him irresistible to some investors, but a drop-off in value may be imminent.",,2022

Don't do it. Don't you dare. Don't be the guy who looks at Story's huge numbers in Colorado and reaches for him to fill your power-hitting infield hole. Be smarter than that. Story's drastic home/road splits tell the full story. In Colorado, he's a menace. Away from the mile high air, he's just another guy. Since 2019, Story's batting average has been 80 points lower away from Denver, and his slugging percentage is 150 points lower.

It's not often a player in a major media market puts up a career season, finishes second in the Cy Young voting and ... nobody seems to notice. Well, friends, Mr. Wheeler would like some more of your attention in 2022, albeit with some caution. His 2.78 ERA last season was a career low. It's likely some regression is coming and his ERA will be in the low 3s. He usually strikes out about a batter an inning, but Wheeler punched out 247 in 213 IP last year. Will he be able to equal that pace? The Phillies are counting on him to do just that at the top of their rotation, but you'd be wise to treat him more like a solid All-Star than a Cy Young favorite. If he's your SP2, life is good. If he's your ace, make sure to load up on solid starting pitching in the mid rounds to bolster your staff behind him.",,2022

You won't be able to sneak Urias past the rest of your league again after his 20-win campaign in 2021. He's primed to join the ranks of the true aces. The Dodgers will win 100 games, with a top-10 defense. Urias is ready to pitch 200 innings and have a top-10 K/BB ratio. The Dodgers always seem to score in bunches when he's on the hill, so Urias might get 20 wins again. After bringing Urias along slowly, the Dodgers will finally unleash the young star. If he throws 210 innings, Urias will far outperform his fourth-round draft projection.",,2022

Perez tied for the MLB lead with 48 home runs in 2021 and had a league-leading 121 RBI. After missing the entire 2019 season due to Tommy John surgery and playing 37 of 60 games in 2020, Perez played 161 games last year (40 as a DH) and went to the plate 665 times. He's bound to get fewer PAs this season, and some HR pullback is probably inevitable, but the Statcast numbers show that Perez crushes the ball when he makes contact. His career batting averages have been all over the map, and he doesn't run, but the power and run production are legit. Perez deserves to be the first catcher off the board, but he might be drafted too early after last season's homer-fest.",,2022

Don't overpay for what you hope Nola will be - the 2018 version of the pitcher who looked like he was on a path to superstardom. Nola's name still resonates, but his stats can be easily replicated four or five rounds after his fourth-round ADP. His 2022 ZiPS projection has him finishing 12-7 with a 3.46 ERA. Other systems are projecting his ERA to be closer to 3.75, which basically makes him Frankie Montas. You'd feel foolish drafting Montas 39th, right? Well, if that was your draft slot plan for Nola, think again.",,2022

Lindor melted like hot butter under the New York spotlight. Last year's $341 million free agent signing was - how do we put this nicely? - awful. Simply awful. There was no pop in his bat, as evidenced by a career-low SLG%. He struck out 96 times in only 125 games, well above his career average, and became an albatross on Mets owner Steve Cohen's hopes and dreams. Lindor is the biggest boom-or-bust top-50 player in the game. If you believe last year was an aberration, snap him up in the late third or early fourth round. If you believe the Mets are going to regret backing up the Brinks truck for a player on an early decline, let someone else get saddled by a name that may well be better than the stats.",,2022

Eventually, Father Time will catch up with the Cardinals slugger. But not this year. If your rival fantasy managers fade Goldy because of his age, take advantage. He can ho-hum his way to 95/30/100/.300, with five to eight stolen bases as a bonus. Goldschmidt will be taken after Austin Riley in most drafts but could easily end up with better numbers at the end of the year.",,2022

Giolito doesn't have pinpoint control, and he gives up his fair share of gopher balls, but those are relatively minor warts on an otherwise sterling profile. He's finished 16th, 4th and 16th in strikeouts over the last three seasons. His worst batting average against over that span is .217. Giolito had a 3.53 ERA last year, but it would have been 3.17 if the Red Sox hadn't shelled him for seven runs in one inning in a disastrous Patriots' Day start. At 27, Giolito is entering the prime of his career, and he should benefit from playing on a good team in a soft division.",,2022

For three straight years, this talented youngster has cut down on his walk rate and increased his strikeout rate. Those are the kinds of year-over-year rate improvements fantasy managers want to see from their SP2 or SP3. There's no reason to believe Alcantra can't be even better this year, building on his 3.19 ERA, 1.07 WHIP and 201 Ks in 205 IP from last season. At 26, he's coming into his prime. If Alcantrara continues to improve, he could easily finish as a top-10 starter.",,2022

Riley's value swings wildly depending on whether you play in an OBP league or a BA league. In the former, he's a four category stud. In the latter, he's a slightly overvalued three category asset. The young slugger should continue to get better, but reaching last year's ceiling may not be realistic. Kim Kardashian has a better chance of winning an Oscar for Best Actress than Riley does of equaling his 2021 second-half .397 BABIP. That said, while you don't want to reach for him based on his RBI numbers last year, the 3B position isn't as deep as usual, so Riley isn't a bad pick in the fifth or sixth round.",,2022

A classic power-hitting first baseman, Alonso is most likely going to deliver 40 HR, 100 RBI and should cross the plate close to 100 times. He's a plug-and-play option.

""It's a deep drive to left field by Castellanos"" has become baseball's best meme, which overshadows the fact that Castellanos has been one of baseball's most underrated power bats over the last half decade. The 29-year-old picked the perfect year to enter free agency, coming off a 2021 campaign with a .576 SLG% and a .938 OPS.

This is one of the riskiest bets in fantasy baseball for 2022. Ray tamed his chronic wildness in 2021, pounding the strike zone with his electric stuff and turning in a Cy Young season. But do you really want to wager that the control problems won't return? Ray walked 2.4 batter per 9 innings last year. His career average is 3.9 walks per 9 innings. Ray yielded a career-low BABIP of .269 last year. If there's regression in Ray's hit and walk rates, the results could be toxic. There's an enormous range of outcomes here. We saw the best of Ray last year, and he was immensely valuable. In his bad seasons, he's been a negative-value player. Where on the spectrum he lands this year is anyone's guess.

Every year, there are arguments about the value of closers. Fantasy managers who consistently win leagues say having one or two elite closers is a season maker. Fantasy managers who say closers are always available on the wire and to never draft one before the 12th round usually spend August and September complaining that they lost the league by a half-dozen points because of a lack of saves and a bloated WHIP. Hader isn't just a closer. His numbers are so spectacular in just one or two innings of work at a time that rostering him is like getting half a season of an ace starter while also getting 35 saves. His Ks can cover for your lower-tier starters who can't reach that baseline K/IP number you want, and his paper-thin WHIP can move the needle. If you're on the wrong end of the snake draft and he's there at the fifth-round/sixth-round turn, grab him and start the closer run.",,2022

Quad and knee injuries limited Springer to 78 games in his first season with the Blue Jays, but he mashed when healthy, with 22 HRs, 50 RBI and 59 runs in just 299 at-bats. Springer has consistently posted batting averages in the .260s or higher during his career, and he'll steal a handful of bases for you. Batting leadoff with Bo Bichette, Vladimir Guerrero and Teoscar Hernandez behind him, Springer has a great chance to score 100 or more runs.

In 71 innings, he had 113 strikeouts and gave up only seven walks. For a second straight year, he gave up fewer than six hits per nine innings. His combined WHIP over the past two years is 0.72.

Get a season of reasonably good health out of Buxton and you're likely to run a profit, probably a big one. But what are the chances he'll play 150 or more games? In the five non-COVID years that he's been on the Twins' Opening Day roster, Buxton has averaged 81.6 games played and 271.2 at-bats. In 2021, Buxton missed 39 games with a strained hip, then broke his hand after being hit with a pitch in his third game back, causing him to miss another month. When healthy, Buxton will steal a lot of bases and score plenty of runs. He's added power, too, and he batted .306 over 61 games last year.

After a forgettable short season in 2020, Altuve tied a career high with 31 home runs last year, scored a career-high 117 runs and had 83 RBI despite hitting in the leadoff spot. The peripherals suggest that Altuve's 2021 HR total was somewhat fluky and park-aided. Altuve used to be good for 30+ stolen bases a season, but he's had 11 SBs in his last two full seasons combined. The days of .300 batting averages may be gone, too. Altuve has been below .300 in each of the last three seasons and has batted .277 over that span. We should at least be able to count on a lot of runs with Altuve batting at the top of a stacked lineup, but the ceiling here isn't what it used to be.

You could do a lot worse than O'Neil as your second outfielder. You're in great shape if somehow your third outfielder. He's a second-tier five-category guy, although O'Neill's .366 BABIP in 2021 suggests that he's probably not going to bat .286 again. The peripherals suggest that O'Neill's power is legit, however. He's not a guy you reach for, but if he starts to fall, grab him. O'Neill is only 26, so it's possible he'll turn in a season that ends up much better than his ADP.",,2022

After belting 10 HRs in 20 playoff games two seasons ago, Arozarena hit 20 homers in 141 games last season and struck out 170 times. A modest flyball rate and ordinary Statcast numbers suggest that Arozarena probably won't provide elite power numbers. Last year's 37% hit rate fueled a .274 batting average that may not be sustainable. On the bright side, he had 20 SBs on 30 attempts. There are a multiple paths to value here, but still, Arozarena is a high-profile player likely to be overdrafted.",,2022

Amazingly, despite those gaudy stats, he'll be the third Brewers starter drafted. Unreal. If he can get any run support, 15 wins isn't out of the question.

After establishing himself as one of MLB's premier innings-eaters in 2019 and 2020, Lynn spent time on IL in 2021 with back and knee problems but was still highly effective, posting a career-best 2.69 ERA. There are a few minor concerns, however. The BABIPs against him the last two years have been .243 and .265. (For his career, it's .301.) Lynn's flyball rate has been on the rise the last two years, which could be a problem since the White Sox play in a bandbox. We might not see another sub-.300 ERA again, but we're likely to see more innings than bad, and Lynn is a good bet to give you a lot of innings.

Give the ascending slugger a mulligan for an ill-fated 2021 season. Jimenez ruptured a pectoral tendon in a spring training game and didn't come back until July 26. His surface stats in his 55 games were decent - 10 HRs, 37 RBI a .249 average - but Jimenez didn't live up to the promise he showed in the shortened 2020 season, when he had 14 HRs, 41 RBI and a .296 average. Expect a rebound and substantial power numbers. Speed isn't part of the package - he's played 232 career games and still hasn't stolen a base - but that's the only weakness here.

If only fantasy baseball awarded points for spectacular defensive plays. Alas, you're stuck relying only on Arenado's bat. That ain't half bad - but it's no longer worth overpaying for. In his first season outside of Colorado, the highlight-reel third baseman showed that he can still rake. But as anticipated, his BA, OBP and OPS all dropped. Now on the wrong side of 30, Arenado is realistically a 2.5-category guy. He'll help you in HR and RBI, and he won't hurt you in runs, but let someone else in your league jump on him early based on name recognition.

In seven full MLB seasons, Abreu has produced 30 or more HRs five times and 100 or more RBI six times.

He's batted .307 and .306 the last two years and has a career average of .297. He also makes solid contributions in HRs, RBI and runs. Seager won't offer much help in the SB department, however. There's little performance risk, but there's a lot of health risk. Seager had both hip surgery and Tommy John surgery in 2018, and he missed more than two months with a broken hand last year. He's in the prime of his career and figures to offer a satisfying return on investment if he can stay healthy.",,2022

At age 30, Gausman finally put it all together over a full season and got himself into the Cy Young conversation. Gausman had a K/BB ratio of 4.5/1 last year and induced swinging strikes on better than 15% of his pitches for a third straight season. His .275 BABIP in 2021 says there was a small element of luck involved, but most of the numbers fully support his banner year (which followed his strong showing in the COVID-shortened 2020 season). Gausman's splitter has become one of the most effective pitches in baseball. The move to the AL East is a mixed bag. On one hand, the Jays should win a lot of games. On the other hand, Gausman will make a good percentage of his starts against the Rays, Red Sox and Yankees.",,2022

Martinez got the bad taste of 2020 out of his mouth with a fine 2021 season. After batting .213 and hitting only seven HRs in the COVID-shortened 2020 campaign, Martinez batted .286 last year with 28 HRs, 99 RBI and 92 runs. Martinez is 34, so there's some age-related risk, but his 2021 Statcast numbers and other peripheral stats suggest that his skill set is aging well. He plays in a great hitter's park, and batting behind Rafael Devers and Xander Bogaerts should provide plenty of RBI opportunities. FantasyPros rankers like Martinez much more than the general public does - an indication that he's probably a value.",,2022

The free-swinging middle infielder signed a six-year, $140 million contract with the Tigers. Baez led the NL with 184 strikeouts last year but also belted 31 homers, had 87 RBI and 80 runs, and batted a respectable .265. This is a strange, volatile skill set, but Baez can usually be counted on to provide help with the counting stats.

If only we could transfer this skill set to a more durable body. Mondesi is a stolen base machine with some surprising pop in his bat, but he hasn't played in more than 102 games or made more than 443 plate appearances in any season, and he's played more than 75 games only once. Leg and foot injuries limited him to only 35 games last year, yet Mondesi still managed to swipe 15 bags and belt six home runs. He strikes out a ton, doesn't take walks and has a .249 career batting average, but his contributions in the counting categories (especially steals) more than make up for it. This is all about risk tolerance, and you're obligated to bake some missed games into Mondesi's price.",,2022

In 2021, Lowe became a full-time player for the first time in his career and responded with 39 HRs, 99 RBI and 97 runs. He batted only .247 last year and struck out 167 times in 615 plate appearances. Lowe has also struggled against lefties throughout his career. But Lowe's first-half/second-half splits were eye-opening. He was batting .208 at the All-Star break; Lowe batted .292 after the break and dramatically reduced his strikeout rate without sacrificing any power. If the second-half adjustments stick, Lowe might actually be able to improve upon his breakout season.",,2022

There's a scene in the movie ""Draft Day"" where the Cleveland Browns GM played by Kevin Costner writes down a name on a sticky note before the draft. It's the name of the one guy he can't leave the draft without. I'll be writing Max Fried's name on my sticky note. Pencil him in for 17 wins on a great Braves team, a top-40 overall ranking, about one strikeout per inning, a beautiful WHIP and an ERA right around the 3.00 mark.

Guys with recurring muscle injuries scare me. They're one wrong step away from missing a month. Marte terrifies me. Ever since his 2019 breakout that had all of us wondering if we'd be better off with Marte or Ozzie Albies (lol, what were we thinking?), Marte has had trouble staying healthy. Arizona is likely to give him more rest this season with the goal of keeping him on the field.

Berrios may have finally arrived as an ace last season, yet he's still very affordable in fantasy drafts. His 3.52 ERA in 2021 was the lowest of his career. Berrios walked just 2.1 batters per nine innings last year and had a K/BB ratio of 4.5/1. He's as durable as they come, having made 32 starts in each of his last three full seasons. Berrios will spend his first full season in the rugged AL East, but with a loaded Blue Jays lineup giving him run support, he has a good chance to exceed 14 wins for the first time in his career. Entering his age-28 season, Berrios should be at the height of his powers.",,2022

After his monster 2019 season (.296, 41 HRs, 112 RBI), Bregman's last two campaigns have been disappointing. Quad and hamstring issues limited him to .348 ABs last season, and he batted .270 with 12 HRs, 55 RBI and 54 runs. Uninspiring Statcast numbers suggest that another 40 HR season isn't in the cards. Bregman is a career .281 hitter, however, and he'll make worthwhile contributions in RBI and runs. Just don't pay for the Bregman of 2018-2019.",,2022

If he stays relatively healthy, Stanton is probably going to contend for the home run crown. But that's a huge ""if,"" obviously. Stanton enjoyed two relatively healthy seasons in 2018-2019, played 41 combined games in 2019-2020, and managed to play 139 games last year with only one stay on the DL for a quad issue. Statcast numbers show that he's still one of the games top sluggers, and he should have better luck in RBIs and runs than he had last season, when he had 97 and 64, respectively. Stanton doesn't run, but he holds his own in batting average. There's a lot of risk here, particularly with Stanton now well into his 30s, but the lengthy injury history almost guarantees a discount in drafts.",,2022

Correa enjoyed one of his finest seasons to date in 2021, establishing new career highs in homers (26) and runs (104). He also had 92 RBI and batted .279. Good health was a key, as he played 148 games. Since breaking into the league in 2015, Correa had played more than 110 games only twice. At 27, Correa is squarely in his prime. His power production is probably maxed out due to his modest flyball rates, but his improved plate patience and robust line drive rates suggest that the healthy batting average and solid run production are easily repeatable. Correa is a free agent, so his landing spot will have a major bearing on his value.",FA,2022

Polanco enjoyed the finest season of his career in 2021, batting .269 with 33 HRs, 98 RBI, 97 runs and 11 SBs. He went nuclear after the All-Star break, batting .287 with 21 homers. Could it be that Polanco feels less pressure as a second baseman than as a shortstop, and his hitting has benefitted as a result? Polanco has always been a line drive machine, so even if the power gains don't stick (and there's a good chance they won't), he should still deliver a healthy batting average. Dual 2B-SS eligibility is a plus. Polanco is a worthy investment, but don't pay for a full repeat of the power.",,2022

If you're the type of manager who loads up on bats early, knowing that there are always pitchers who'll turn in solid numbers available later on - guys who'll give you 25-30 starts and won't have more than a few clunkers - Musgrove is your guy. In San Diego's pitcher's park with a good defense behind him, Musgrove should produce solid strikeout totals, with a mid-3.00s ERA and a low 1.10s WHIP. Draft him. Play him.

Webb is going too high in drafts for my liking. He altered his pitching style after a horrid start last year, but will that be enough to continue to stymie hitters once they've had time to adjust to him? His hot finish to the 2021 season on a scorching Giants team propelled him higher on draft boards than his stats warrant. Fantasy managers can find a bunch of starting pitchers who'll finish the season within a couple ticks of Webb in ERA, WHIP and Ks and will be available 20-30 spots after Webb's seventh-round ADP.",,2022

Montas has taken his investors on a wild ride the past few seasons. He got off to a fast start in 2019 but received an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a banned substance. Montas pitched poorly in 2020, posting a 5.60 ERA and 1.51 WHIP in 11 starts. Last year, Montas took a 6.20 ERA into May but then pulled it all together and was lights-out in the second half, with a 2.17 ERA in 14 starts after the All-Star break. Increase usage of his elite splitter spiked his swinging-strike rated and helped him rack up a career-high 207 strikeouts. It's been a bumpy ride, but it seems like Montas has figured things out.",,2022

The way you regard Yelich depends on what type of fantasy manager you are. Do you like rolling the dice on potential superstars who can't stay upright? Or would you rather take a lesser player and know you'll get 150 games out of him? If you're in the latter category, Yelich is probably on your do-not-draft list. His upside is huge, but the now-30-year-old outfielder dealt with serious back issues last season, and back injuries have a tendency to reoccur.",,2022

What is zero? The odds that Reynolds stays on the Pittsburgh roster all season. Thanks for playing FantasyPros Jeopardy. I like Reynolds. You should like Reynolds. He has a chance to be a sneaky difference maker, a guy who'll get dealt in July and make a huge difference on a playoff team.

Morton is 38 years old. He's coming back from a broken fibula. And yet, he's a perfect SP3 target. Morton is the Honda Civic in your driveway that just refuses to die. It delivers reliable performance, week in and week out. Excluding the off-kilter 2020 pandemic short season, Morton has given managers a sub-3.40 ERA and sub-1.20 WHIP with good strikeout totals and double-digit wins in four straight seasons.

He hasn't turned into the superstar we thought he was going to become, but he's still got power and will still knock in runs, and now he'll be doing his mashing at Coors Field.

Full disclosure:, I have a little man(ager) crush on India. The NL Rookie of the Year saved my season last year after some early middle infield injuries. He's a five-category option who will still be available in the eighth round or beyond. But beware: He's not going to get a lot of help in the lineup to bolster his RBI and run totals. Cincy is not going to be a good team. Without slugger Nick Castellanos and some other veteran bats the team plans on trading away, India will be a man on an island.

The Angels' closer keeps getting better and better. His K rate has risen in each of the last three seasons. His walk rate has shrunk in each of the last four seasons. Iglesias struck out 103 batters in 70 innings last year and walked only 12. He's notched at least 28 saves in each of his last four full seasons going back to 2017, and he's cemented his reputation as one of the best, most reliable closers in the game. If you don't have the stomach for saves speculation and are willing to pay for quality, Iglesias is well worth the price.",,2022

If Castillo is on your target list, make sure to buy a big bottle of Tums. By the end of the season, you'll probably be happy with your decision, to roster him, but there will be long stretches of the season where you'll be driven to the breaking point while following Castillo's starts on Stat Tracker. He's a notoriously slow starter, so be prepared for a bumpy ride until June. I've ridden the Reds ace through multiple tumultuous seasons, and I can't do it again. If you have a stronger constitution than I do, know that Castillo has SP1 stuff and will probably be worth it over the long haul.",,2022

Some of us still want to think of the 28-year-old Realmuto, who was the best catcher in baseball. But he's entering his age-31 season and is likely on the downside of his career. Catchers tend to fall off precipitously after age 30, so Realmuto will have to stave off Father Time. Double-digit steals from the catcher slot are always a bonus for fantasy managers, but Realmuto is no longer a catcher for whom you should reach. The Phillies' lineup is full of holes and won't provide much support outside of Bryce Harper. However, the universal DH rule adds to Realmuto's value. He'll get more at bats and more rest for his legs. He's still a great option at catcher. Just don't reach.",,2022

If you were targeting J.T. Realmuto and he gets snapped up, take Smith with your next pick. He has the goods to become the best catcher in the game, and with the universal DH now the law of the land, Smith becomes even more valuable. Now that he'll get at-bats as a designated hitter, a 30 HR, 90 RBI season isn't out of the question. Getting that kind of elite production from your catcher spot anchors your offense and allows you all kinds of trade flexibility down the road.",,2022

If you like your closers to deliver saves with a side of anxiety, Diaz is your guy. He gets the job done, but it won't always be pretty. The Mets have tried to overhaul their team this offseason, so Diaz should be in position to save more games in 2022 than in 2021. The flamethrower is an elite strikeout option at the position. When the closer run starts, Diaz is a relatively safe top-10 choice at the position.",,2022

Missed out on some of the big strikeout pitchers early? Nobody on your roster is projected to pass the 250 K mark? Heading into the eighth round and worried? Darvish is your answer. He's going to get swings and misses. He still has an outstanding, varied pitch repertoire. Sure, his ERA won't win you any leagues, but it won't hurt you much, and he'll pair it with a low WHIP. Darvish's issue has always been his propensity to give up the long ball. Playing half his games in San Diego's generous dimensions should limit the damage.",,2022

The 24-year-old is flying up dynasty draft boards, as his numbers project continued growth from a starter who paid off big as a 2021 sleeper selection. But if you're not in a dynasty league, don't overpay. Rogers is unlikely to match his 2.65 ERA from last season, and it's safe to expect some WHIP regression. His impressive strikeout rate is for real and there's a huge runway in front of him. If you think he's bound for a sustained breakout and have faith he can replicate or beat last season, jump on him about 75 to 80 picks in. If he's still there as you close in on pick 100, snatch him up.",,2022

Winker's value drops with the move to Seattle, which has one of the most pitcher-friendly parks in MLB. He should still provide a solid batting average, but aspirations of 30 HR and 90 RBI now seem far-fetched. Winker is yet another player who deals with chronic injuries.

Let me introduce you to my second base draft target. Just 24 years old, Chisholm offers a tantalizing combination of power and speed. If he makes the necessary offseason adjustments to hit breaking pitches better, Chisholm will deliver an all-star season. He'll max out as a four category guy until he gets his average up, but for a guy ranked outside of the top 10 in nearly every set of 2B rankings, Chisholm looks like a potential draft steal.

Cease showed a lot of growth last season, drastically increasing his strikeout rate (top four percent in MLB) while seeing a corresponding drop in both his walk-rate and HR/9. But to take the next leap, he's going to have to increase his efficiency, as he barely averaged five innings per start. There's a pretty plausible path to Cease finishing as a top-15 starter, and it largely involves him continuing to hone his command, particularly with his inconsistent curveball. If he does, and he can avoid the blow-up outings, then Cease has the makings of a fantasy ace. If he can't, then he'll likely still be a productive, albeit inconsistent, starter for your team.",,2022

Sports hernia surgery caused him to miss the 2020 season, but Haniger returned in a big way last year, posting career highs in home runs (39), RBI (100) and runs (110). There are some warning signs here, however. Haniger's strikeout rate has gone through the roof, and his on-base percentage has plummeted. His exit velocities suggest that he won't match last year's HR total. The good news is that Haniger's banner 2021 season hasn't driven his price sky-high. Still, some caution is warranted.",,2022

Most fantasy managers expected James Karinchak to be Cleveland's closer last year, but Clase simply could not be denied. His miniscule 1.29 ERA and 0.96 WHIP were largely earned, and he ranked in the top one percent of the league in barrel rate, xERA, wOBA, and xWOBA. His cutter/slider combination is one of the best in the league, and he routinely sits at over 100 miles per hour with good command. With his raw stufdf being as good as it is, there's little reason to doubt that Clase can repeat his 2021 performance. Draft him as one of the first relievers off the board.",,2022

Reyes crushes the ball and has the potential to become one of MLB's elite power hitters. The problem is that he hits the ball on the ground way too often. He had a 46% groundball rate in 2021 and a 36% flyball rate. That's a low flyball rate for a power hitter, and yet it's the highest of Reyes's four-year career. His 64% contact rate last year suggests there's worrisome BA downside here. Reyes doesn't steal bases. His run totals have been unimpressive and don't figure to improve with the bottom of the Cleveland batting order looking so anemic. And Reyes is only DH-eligible in most leagues. Reyes could lead the AL in homers if he makes launch-angle adjustments, but let someone else chase that dream.",,2022

After years of battling injuries and ineffectiveness, Rodon blossomed last year with a 2.37 ERA and 0.96 WHIP. Everything worked for the lefty, as his fastball (.199 BAA) and slider (.107 BAA) were borderline unhittable, and he ranked in the top four percent of the league in strikeout rate. He dealt with shoulder soreness and fatigue during the second half of the season, but that didn't stop the Giants from giving him a huge two-year deal. Oracle Park isn't quite the pitcher haven it once was, but it's a huge upgrade for Rodon after pitching in Guaranteed Rate Field last year. The injury risk will always be present for Rodon, but he's worth an investment if you make sure to bank on 150 innings or fewer.",,2022

A medley of injuries limited Rendon to 58 games and 249 plate appearances in 2021. He batted over .300 in each of his last three seasons with the Nationals, but Rendon's BA slipped to .286 in the COVID-shortened 2020 season and bottomed out at a career-low .240 last year. When he's at his best, Rendon is a choosy hitter who racks up extra-base hits and makes significant contributions in every category except stolen bases. He's slightly past prime age, but we should still expect a bounce-back season from Rendon, and he's very affordable in drafts.",,2022

The last thing you want to do is pass on a former MVP who can be had in the middle rounds because his draft stock is plummeting. The second-to-last-thing you want to do is grab a player hoping for a bounce-back season and bang your head on a desk every night as he continues his affair with the Mendoza line. What if last year's crater season was an aberration? Worse, what if it wasn't? Bellinger is still only 26, but he won't have 1B eligibility in most formats, leaving him eligible for OF only. Oh, heck, if he's still there in the ninth or 10th round, take a chance. And find a bottle of Advil.",,2022

Manoah was largely as advertised last year with Toronto, pitching to a 3.22 ERA and 1.05 WHIP. His fastball (.288 wOBA) and slider (.238 wOBA) were a deadly combination, though he's probably going to need to continue to develop his changeup to truly excel as a starter. With that said, Manoah is just 24 years old and already boasts two elite pitches with a solid MLB season under his belt. He may pitch in a tough division and a hitter-friendly ballpark, but given his pedigree and potential for more, he's someone to draft as a high-end No. 3 starter with little hesitation.",,2022

A fractured wrist has changed the draft calculus on Tatis Jr., who might be out for as long as three months. It's always taken an iron stomach to draft him and deal with the injury risk. When healthy, he's a multi-category box score stuffer. His counting numbers are so orbital, he's basically a seven-category player ... when he's on the field.

Pressly was his usual excellent self in the bullpen last year, pitching to a 2.25 ERA and a 0.97 WHIP with a 32.4% strikeout rate, his fourth straight season with at least a 31% mark. His fantasy value was held in check by his oddly-low save total of 26, but that was hardly his fault. The Astros as a team had only 34 saves total, which was tied with the Blue Jays for the lowest mark by a .500 team or better. Houston averaged 46.5 saves over the team's previous two full seasons, so expect them to approach that mark again and for Pressly's save total to jump by at least five or more. If you can grab a discount based on his low number last year, do so.",,2022

Chapman struggled with his control last year, walking 15.8% of the batters he faced and struggling with a 1.31 WHIP. But that was mostly window dressing on what was just another dominant season for the Yankees closer. As usual, his strikeout rate hovered at around 40% and he reached the 30-save mark for the eighth time in his last nine full seasons. Yes, he's getting up there in age and he's not nearly as dominant as he once was. But his job security remains high and his strikeouts continue to be elite for a reliever. Draft him with confidence.",,2022

So far so good for Verlander, who has pitched just six innings over his last two seasons after undergoing Tommy John surgery. His spring has gone as expected thus far, and he's on track for the start of the season, though he might miss the first turn as the Astros play it safe. Verlander is now 39 years old and has a ton of miles on his arm, and it's difficult to know exactly how his stuff will play after two years of not pitching competitively. But the bottom line is that the last fantasy managers saw of Verlander, he was as dominant as he has ever been, so there shouldn't be too many doubts about his performance. Given his age and his injury, it's likely the Astros will look to limit Verlander's innings a bit, but so long as he has no setbacks during the spring, draft him with confidence this year.",,2022

McClanahan had a successful 2021 season in almost every respect. His ERA, strikeouts, and walk rate were all extremely solid, and he made 26 starts including the post-season. Despite decent control, he had a bloated 1.27 ERA, which was largely the result of batters destroying his fastball. Specifically, the pitch allowed a .308 batting average and a .378 wOBA, and considering he threw it 40.9% of the time, McClanahan's overall numbers are a testament to how good his slider and curveball were. Assuming he can get better command of his fastball and improve his performance with the pitch, there's plenty of room for growth with the young lefty.",,2022

Walsh was outstanding in his rookie year, blasting 29 home runs and batting .277. His expected batting average (.257) and slugging percentage (.436) lagged significantly behind his actual numbers, but his 114.8 MPH maximum exit velocity was in the top six percent of MLB and suggests his power is real. Walsh couldn't hit a lick against lefties last year, as he batted just .170 against them with a .565 OPS. But, even if he loses time against them, his success against righties should be more than enough to keep him relevant. Buy him as a 30-homer bat but take at least 10 to 20 points off his batting average from last year.",,2022

Mountcastle fully arrived in his age-24 season, shaking off a slow start to finish with 33 HR, 89 RBI, 77 runs and a reasonable .255 batting average. His .333 BA in the abbreviated 2020 season was a mirage, but Mountcastle's power is legit, with a .232 ISO in 2021 and home runs on 20% of his flyballs. There's a lot of swing-and-miss to Mountcastle's game, which could make him a BA risk, and he won't steal many bases. But the power profile is enticing, and it's a nice bonus that Mountcastle has dual eligibility as an outfielder and first baseman.",,2022

There's a lot to like here. The biggest draws are speed and multi-position (OF/2B) eligibility. Edman stole 30 bases last year, tying for fourth in MLB. Statcast says he's in the 92nd percentile for sprint speed. There's a little bit of power here, too. Edman hit only 11 HRs last year but clubbed 41 doubles. Edman has a .272 batting average over three seasons, and there could be room for growth there. His contact rate improved to 85% last year, and he sprays hits to both sides of the diamond. Edman doesn't take many walks, but that's a minor nit to pick.",,2022

This ageless wonder will turn 42 on July 1 but continues to mash. He'll do his mashing for the Nationals this year after signing a one-year deal. Cruz belted 32 home runs last year, which was actually his lowest total for a full season since 2013. He was batting .294 for Minnesota before being traded to Tampa, where he hit only .226 the rest of the way. At his age, the decline could come quickly, but exit velocity, barrel rate and other power peripherals say he's still going strong.",,2022

Here's a guy you just can't go wrong with. He has immaculate control, ace-level stuff, a really high floor and an exceptional Cy Young-level ceiling. Flaherty only pitched 78 innings last season due to shoulder and oblique injuries, but he didn't suffer any structural damage in his shoulder - it was just a strain - so that shouldn't have any lingering impact this season. He's otherwise been pretty durable. One thing to consider is that after being limited last year, Flaherty may have a cap of about 140-150 innings.",,2022

Sometimes, things work out just the way fantasy managers expect them to. Cron became a prime sleeper when he signed with Colorado, and fantasy managers hoped that he could maintain his strong power numbers while letting Coors Field positively impact his batting average. That's exactly what happened, as Cron hit 28 home runs with a career-best .281 average. He also upped his walk rate significantly to 11%, which resulted in both a career-best OBP (.375) and run scored total (70). It's unclear if his gains in plate discipline are sustainable, but it's hard to find too many reasons to doubt his performance so long as he remains in Colorado. He's a fine low-end first base option or a prime target for your corner infield spot.",,2022

Snell is an every-other-year pitcher. Over his six year career, his ERA has been good in even years (averaging 2.89) and pedestrian in odd years (4.17). Is that scientific? No, of course not, but you're playing a game based on other people playing a game. Let's have some leeway here. Well, friends, it's an even year. So go ahead and make Snell your SP3.",,2022

Sale returned from Tommy John surgery last year and mostly looked like his old self. His velocity was close to pre-surgery levels, and though his strikeout rate dropped a smidge, he was basically the same ace he's always been. A .358 BABIP against Sale last year suggests he got unlucky, yet he still posted a 3.16 ERA. Health is really the only concern for Sale, who was an All-Star for seven straight seasons from 2012 to 2018. If he's healthy, the lanky lefty should again be one of the best power pitchers in the game.",,2022

Witt was drafted everywhere after buzz in the spring suggested that he'd be up in the majors before long. ""Before long"" became never, as Witt spent the entire year in Double-A and Triple-A, admittedly showing why he's such a valued prospect. In 123 games combined between the levels, he hit 33 home runs and stole 29 bases, all with a plus average. Witt should begin the year in the majors (or be up shortly after the start of the season), and he'll almost certainly play third base, giving him dual-eligibility. He may struggle early on, but he's too talented to let it continue for long. At a barren third base position, he could be one of the most impactful players in fantasy baseball this year based on his ADP.",NRI,2022

Hoskins traded off some walks for some additional power last year, as he consistently made harder contact than he ever had before in his career. His 91.2 MPH average exit velocity and 112.2 MPH maximum exit velocity were both career highs, and his 17% barrel rate ranked in the top 6% of baseball. The only real problem for Hoskins, aside from his .240-ish batting average, is his difficulty staying healthy. He was limited to just 107 games last year because of an abdominal injury and he missed about a third of 2020's shortened season. The talent is there - he'll hit plenty of home runs and he'll likely bat in front of Bryce Harper and J.T. Realmuto. Just bank on closer to 120 games rather than a full season.",,2022

Swanson is the type of player that you're not excited to draft but who you know will give you reliable production. At this stage of his career, he's pretty much a .250-25-10 type of bat who should give you about 165 combined runs and RBI in a strong Braves lineup. There's been nearly no change to Swanson's underlying metrics and data over the last three seasons, and though he could show some growth as he moves into his late-20s, chances are that he just is who he is. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially since his price is always kept in check by his lack of excitement. If you miss out on the prime shortstops, he's a fine consolation prize late in drafts.",,2022

Cronenworth quietly had a very solid season for the Padres, totaling 21 home runs and exactly an .800 OPS. He's not an exciting player - he doesn't have a ton of power or speed and his batting average won't wow you. But he'll bat second for the Padres this year and so you can expect him to challenge the 94 runs scored he totaled last season. He also struck out just 14% of the time last year, which ranked in the top 10% in MLB, so he's unlikely to endure prolonged slumps, and consistent production goes further in today's fantasy landscape than it used to. Add to that his multi-position eligibility and Cronenworth makes an ideal part of any fantasy team, particularly one with daily lineup changes.",,2022

On the one hand, Meadows largely bounced back from the horror story that was the abbreviated 2020 season. His strikeout rate normalized, his power returned, and his playing time stabilized. The glaring exception was that he could not correct his sudden struggles against lefties. In 2019, Meadows slashed .275/.316/.521 against southpaws. Last year, he slashed just .198/.270/.293 against them. Even if Meadows's overall numbers are passable, it seems unlikely that a team like the Rays are going to let a player who is merely an average defender continue to keep an everyday job when he's virtually useless against left-handed throwers. That would still leave Meadows on the strong side of a platoon, but if he does begin to sit more regularly, his counting stats will take a hit, and fantasy managers should be aware of that before they select him in their drafts.",,2022

Muncy had a fantastic 2021 season with 36 homers, making it his third straight full season in which he reached the 35-homer plateau. But he tore the UCL in his elbow late in the year and missed the playoffs, and the fantasy baseball world has been holding its collective breath hoping that he'll be able to be ready for Opening Day this year. All signs - and Dave Roberts's comments - point to Muncy being available, and the addition of the DH to the National League can only help his cause. But although a torn UCL isn't nearly the same injury for a position player that it is for a pitcher, Muncy will still likely see some limitations and need some time off this year. Expect his usual excellent production, but knock off 10-20 games from his usual output.",,2022

Schwarber was really, really good in 2020. He ranked in the top 10% of the league in barrel rate, average and maximum exit velocity, hard-hit rate, walk percentage, and wOBA. He also batted a career-best .266, probably because he swung at far fewer pitches outside the strike zone than he ever had before. He'll now bat near or at the top of a strong Phillies lineup in a park that should only accentuate Schwarber's raw power. If Schwarber can hold the gains he saw last year - being more selective, hitting more line drives, etc. - then he should be in for perhaps his best season to date.",,2022

You don't often see a rebound season like Votto put up last year, and it was glorious. After three years of minimal power, Votto exploded for 36 home runs and a .563 slugging percentage. His Statcast page is a joy to look at - he was among he leaders in hard-hit rate, barrel percentage, exit velocity - and all greatly improved from his last few seasons. Yes, he struck out at a career-worst clip nd his batting average isn't ever going to approach .300 again, but that's just nitpicking. The bigger worry for Votto at this point is the total lack of protection in the Reds lineup, as Cincinnati has traded the vast majority of its decent offensive pieces. But that might prevent a buying opportunity for fantasy managers if Votto's ADP slips too far.",,2022

LeMahieu seems like the poster child for the effect of the juiced ball. After drastically increasing his home run power over the previous few seasons, he hit just 10 home runs last year and his slugging percentage dropped to .362. LeMahieu had offseason surgery to repair a hernia, so perhaps his injury was bothering him longer than he let on and is responsible for his down year. But it's equally possible that at 33 years old, and without the juiced ball, LeMahieu just isn't as valuable a fantasy commodity as he used to be. Chances are, at the very least, that the days of a .300-plus batting average are gone, and now with likely low-teens home run potential, LeMahieu is more of a late-round pick whose main value is his position flexibility.",,2022

Bell had a horrid .464 OPS in April, likely because his timing was off after missing time because of a COVID-19 diagnosis. But once he found his footing, he was everything that Nationals hoped he would be. He batted .277 with an .887 OPS in the second half, and even played plenty of outfield so Washington could keep his bat in the lineup even with Ryan Zimmerman playing well. His walk percentage and strikeout rate largely returned to their pre-2020 levels, and he got better and better as the season went along. With Zimmerman now retired and the DH in the National League, Bell's bat should remain in the lineup nearly every day, and the presence of Juan Soto and Nelson Cruz should offer him plenty of RBI opportunities. He's not a fantasy superstar, but he's a capable starter at first base for your fantasy team.",,2022

Lopez was limited to 102.2 innings last year as he (again) dealt with a shoulder injury. But when he did pitch, he was excellent. A 3.07 ERA, a 1.12 WHIP and a 27.5% strikeout rate all added plus value to fantasy rosters. Lopez primarily relies on a fastball/changeup combination, and he'll probably need to take the next step with either his curveball or cutter to take the next step. But his current production is plenty good enough, and he's an ideal third starter for your fantasy team.",,2022

Kershaw isn't the same pitcher he was at his peak, but he's still really, really good. His curveball doesn't have quite the same bite and his fastball has fallen off a bit, but his slider is one of the best in baseball. Kershaw really leaned into that pitch last year (he used it 47.6% of the time), so it's no surprise that he dealt with forearm issues at the end of the season. And injuries are now unfortunately a common thing for the veteran, as he's dealt with back, shoulder, and now elbow injuries over the past several years. He's back with the Dodgers on a one-year deal and is reportedly healthy. There's still a ton of room for profit with him, but you shouldn't count on much more than 120 innings.",,2022

Grisham was . . . fine last year. His 15 homers and 13 steals contributed, particularly given that he missed time with injury. But there just wasn't much to get excited about. There's probably more to be had in the stolen base department, as Grisham ranks in the 91st percentile in sprint speed. And he should bat atop the lineup this year with Fernando Tatis set to miss time. But your best-case scenario is a 20-15 line with a batting average that hurts. That's a startable player in fantasy, but not one you should reach for in drafts.",,2022

Bassitt's success feels uncomfortable - he doesn't have a ton of velocity or much of a secondary pitch beyond his sinker. But year in and year out, he offers an ERA and WHIP that help fantasy managers. His 25% strikeout rate last year was a career-best, and his deep arsenal helps to keep hitters off balance. He'll lose out on some park value with the move from Oakland to New York, but chances are he will improve on his meager win totals from the last few years. There's no ceiling ith Bassitt, but there's an extremely high floor, so sticking him in the back-end of your rotation is a winning move.",,2022

Rodriguez had an awful 2021 season, but his 4.74 ERA was backed up by a 3.32 FIP and 3.50 xERA. His walk percentage and strikeout rate were actually career bests, and he made at least 31 starts for the second consecutive season. Really, it was just a lot of bad luck for Rodriguez, as his .363 BABIP against and 68.9% LOB %, both career-worsts, showed. He'll face an easier slate of lineups now that he's with Detroit, but his ceiling is fairly low given that he's really got just one truly reliable pitch in his fastball. He could theoretically finally beat his career best 3.81 ERA and 1.26 WHIP, but there's just not enough upside for him to be anything but a back-end-of-the-rotation type of arm.",,2022

Valdez fractured his ring finger just before the start of the season and although there were rumors he could miss the entire season, he wound up making 22 starts and throwing 134 2/3 innings. He lost some of the gains he had made with his control, but he induced ground balls at a 70.3% clip, an absurd rate. Valdez has one great pitch - his curveball - and his value is highly dependent on the quality of his defense. So the chances of him taking a great leap are minimal. But what he provides is plenty good enough to be a mid-tier starter for your fantasy team.",,2022

Mahle is your quintessential fantasy rotation filler. His ERA (3.75) and WHIP (1.23) won't really hurt you and he'll throw enough innings, but because he's primarily a fastball pitcher with little else in his arsenal, there's so little upside. That's especially true because he pitches in a hitter-friendly environment and for a team that has traded nearly every decent offensive piece. That means wins should be hard to come by and with Mahle's upside cap, make sure not to draft him too early.",,2022

Jansen signed a one-year deal with the Braves and will slide right into the cloer's role. There is a lot of mileage on his arm, but he had a strong rebound season last year, dropping his ERA to a 2.22 and his WHIP to 1.04, all while tallying 38 saves for the Dodgers. After losing velocity for several seasons, Jansen got it back last year, averaging 92.5 MPH with his cutter, which resulted in just a .176 batting average against, his best since 2016. Assuming he can sustain his gains, he should again be a top reliever, and his hefty contract should at least give him a decent leash in the ninth inning. He's plenty capable of being your anchor reliever.",FA,2022

If ever a player needed a trade, it was Adames. In his career, he has batted just .217 with a .616 OPS in Tropicana Field. And he was particularly dreadful with the Rays last year, slashing .197/.254/.371. He was an entirely different player after his trade to the Brewers, hitting 20 home runs in 99 games, with nearly a .900 OPS. He's probably due for some regression, as he outperformed his expected batting average and slugging percentage pretty significantly last season. But even if you knock off 20% of what we saw him do with the Brewers last season, he'd still be a startable option in fantasy. He's unlikely to take the leap into stardom, but he can and should certainly maintain the leap he took last year into relevance.",,2022

Gurriel cut his strikeout rate to a career-best 18.9%, but that's pretty much where the good news ends. His quality of contact dropped significantly (at least in some part due to a knee injury he played through), resulting in a sharp downturn in both his home runs and slugging percentage. Playing for a ridiculously strong Toronto offense will keep his counting stats relatively afloat, and he may bat higher in the order with Marcus Semien in Texas now. And he's entering his age-28 season so perhaps there's a power bump coming. But Gurriel looks much more like a player who you draft because he won't hurt you, not because he'll help you a ton.",,2022

Romano wasn't always used as a traditional closer last year, but he firmly established himself as Toronto's best reliever and wound up with 23 saves. Romano sits at 97 MPH with his fastball and it's just been an absolutely dominant pitch over the last two seasons, particularly when combined with his above-average slider. He's a reliever with a limited track record which means his volatility is high. But there are few closing situations where fantasy managers can feel confident about who is going to get the ball in the ninth inning - Toronto's is one of them, and that means Romano should be considered a top-10 reliever.",,2022

The truth is that Mancini was just a bit lucky in 2019, as he outperformed his expected numbers in nearly every category, and was comparably unlucky in 2021, underperforming those same numbers by similar amounts. His true version likely lies somewhere in between, and that's not a bad thing.

Garcia came out of absolutely nowhere last season to become one of just five players to hit at least 31 home runs and steal at least 16 bases. His success largely came early in the season, as he blasted 11 home runs in May with a .312 batting average before, as most fantasy managers expected, pitchers adjusted. The adjustment hit Garcia hard, as he slashed just .211/.256/.370 in the second half, though he stole seven bases over the final month of the season to cushion the blow. The issue for Garcia is the same that plagues most largely unknown hitters who put up huge hot streaks - he lacks plate discipline. His strikeout rate (31.2%) and walk rate (5.1%) were both in the bottom six percent of MLB, and both were due largely to the fact that he simply swings too much at pitches outside of the zone (39.7 O-Swing%, ninth-worst in the league). The Rangers have a much-improved lineup and perhaps Garcia will improve in his second year, but unless he drastically changes his approach, his numbers are going to have a hard cap on them.",,2022

Hayes had major buzz heading into 2021 after he batted .376 with a 1.124 OPS in 24 games in 2020. But his season went south nearly from the start, after he missed significant time with a wrist injury and continued to battle hand and wrist issues even after he returned. His hard-hit rate, average exit velocity and barrel percentage all dropped significantly, and it's fair to write if fantasy managers want to write all that off to his injury issues. But it's equally fair to acknowledge that Hayes's strong 2020 season was out of line with his minor-league career, and that fantasy managers were putting way too much stock into an incredibly small sample. The good news is that, unlike last year, fantasy managers won't need to pay a high price for Hayes, and in the wasteland (in terms of fantasy production) that is the third base position, Hayes makes a passable option at the hot corner in deeper leagues. Just make sure you draft some depth behind him in case he struggles again.",,2022

Carlson rebounded from a disastrous 2020 season to put up a respectable .266/.343/.437 line with 18 home runs last year. But the dreams of fantasy superstardom after his 2019 minor-league season (26 homers, 20 steals) have been put on hold, as he seems to have little interest in stealing bases in the majors (three total in two seasons), and his hard-hit rate was in the bottom nine percent of the league last year. His numbers and underlying metrics suggest that he's a slightly above-average MLB player, though it's worth remembering that he's just 23 years old and there's certainly potential for more. Drafting Carlson as a fourth outfielder with upside for more is the right approach, as he should bring a fairly solid floor with potential for a high ceiling if everything comes together.",,2022

Baz's pure stuff has always been electric, as he combines elite velocity with an outstanding curveball and slider. Prior to last year, his command was the only thing holding him back, but he blossomed in Double-A and kept his gains in control throughout his three-game stint in the majors. A rough postseason start aside, 2021 was all gravy for Baz, and the Rays undoubtedly expect him to be a contributor to their rotation this year. But he did pitch just 92 innings last season, and given his age, fantasy managers should expect the Rays to cap him at about 130 innings or so.
