Ronald Acuna Jr. is a top pick for all 2024 fantasy leagues. At 25, he showcased his prowess in 2023 by playing 159 games with a .337/.416/.596 slash line. His remarkable performance included 41 homers, 106 RBIs, and 149 runs. Impressively, he also stole 73 bases. Acuna excelled against nearly all pitch types and maintained a low strikeout rate of 11.4%. Despite a slightly lower walk percentage, he redefined a five-category fantasy player. If you have the top pick, don't overthink it.",,2024
2,Julio Rodriguez,SEA,OF,2.0,2.0,Julio Rodriguez (SEA - OF),425,.278|99R|31HR|93RBI|31SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/julio-rodriguez-of.php,Rodriguez,".278|99R|31HR|93RBI|31SB
At the end of June 2023, no one would have said Julio Rodriguez should be a first-round pick in 2024 fantasy drafts. The 22-year-old had a slash line of .238/.302/.407 through the first three months of the season. Yet, his post-July performance was remarkable, hitting .312/.364/.561, contributing 32 HRs, 37 SBs, and over 100 runs and RBIs. Despite a 24.5% strikeout rate, his overall .279 average and balanced stats make him a strong OF1 for fantasy managers.",,2024
3,Bobby Witt Jr.,KC,SS,3.0,3.0,Bobby Witt Jr. (KC - SS),455,.278|97R|29HR|90RBI|42SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/bobby-witt-jr.php,Witt Jr.,".278|97R|29HR|90RBI|42SB
Bobby Witt Jr. showed up for his second season and made strides across the board. The 24-year-old played in 158 games and hit 30 home runs. He also stole 49 bases, scored 97 runs, drove in 96, and slashed .276/.319/.495. Finding a 30/30 guy eligible for third base used to be reserved for Jose Ramirez, but the torch has been passed. The sole knock against Witt is the team he plays for, but that seems like splitting hairs, considering he almost managed to go 100/100 anyway. Witt should be the first third baseman off the board in 2024, and if he's not someone else's, he should be yours.",,2024
4,Corbin Carroll,ARI,OF,4.0,10.0,Corbin Carroll (ARI - OF),438,.276|103R|25HR|79RBI|44SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/corbin-carroll-of.php,Carroll,".276|103R|25HR|79RBI|44SB
Corbin Carroll arrived on the scene in 2023 and immediately showcased his power and speed, launching 25 homers and swiping 54 bases. He crossed the plate 116 times and notched 76 RBIs. With a solid .362 on-base percentage, Carroll stands out, especially given his top-tier speed, ranked in the 99th percentile. There is concern that his OBP was slightly inflated, which could slightly dampen his numbers, but he is still a solid first-round pick. Carroll's contact skills hint at sustained high-level performance into 2024 and beyond.",,2024
5,Mookie Betts,LAD,"2B,OF",5.0,4.0,"Mookie Betts (LAD - 2B,OF)",507,.283|120R|34HR|92RBI|14SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/mookie-betts.php,Betts,".283|120R|34HR|92RBI|14SB
Mookie Betts, at 30, continues to be an elite asset in fantasy baseball with a .307/.408/.579 slash line, 39 homers, 126 runs, and 107 RBIs in 2023. Though his 14 stolen bases are modest, Betts compensates with power and a superb eye, boasting a 13.9% walk rate and an elite 15.4% strikeout rate. He continued to be durable, playing in 152 games with 693 plate appearances. As Betts ages, expect a trade-off of speed for power, yet with a sustained high average. The Dodgers' strong lineup bolsters him, and his multi-position eligibility makes him a dependable, Top-6 fantasy asset.",,2024
6,Kyle Tucker,HOU,OF,6.0,5.0,Kyle Tucker (HOU - OF),498,.286|94R|31HR|104RBI|25SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/kyle-tucker.php,Tucker,".286|94R|31HR|104RBI|25SB
Kyle Tucker nearly achieved a 30/30 season and topped the American League with 112 RBIs last year. His walk rate hit a career-high of 11.9%, while his strikeout rate dropped to 13.6%. In 5x5 leagues, his .284/.369/.517 line was impressive. Tucker's consistent underlying metrics hint at sustained production, and he is poised for a 35/25 season in 2024. Don't forget about him in the first round on draft day.",,2024
7,Freddie Freeman,LAD,1B,7.0,9.0,Freddie Freeman (LAD - 1B),497,.306|110R|26HR|97RBI|13SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/freddie-freeman.php,Freeman,".306|110R|26HR|97RBI|13SB
Freddie Freeman has established himself as an irreplaceable cornerstone for the Dodgers, entering 2024 as one of baseball's most consistent and elite performers. At 34, he's defying age-related expectations, showcasing a blend of power, skill, and speed rarely seen at his position. In 2023, Freeman delivered an elite .334 batting average while driving in 101 runs and smashing 28 home runs. He also reached the milestone of 200 hits for the first time in his career. His season was filled with career highs, including 21 stolen bases, 125 runs scored, and 56 doubles, nearing the first 60-double season in the majors since 1936. Heading into 2024, Freddie Freeman isn't just an asset for the Dodgers; he's a fantasy baseball gem, offering a rare mix of average, power, and speed. He should be the first 1B off the board.",,2024
8,Aaron Judge,NYY,"DH,OF",8.0,8.0,"Aaron Judge (NYY - DH,OF)",477,.277|109R|45HR|108RBI|8SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/aaron-judge.php,Judge,".277|109R|45HR|108RBI|8SB
In 2023, Aaron Judge played 106 games, the least since 2019. Despite this, he delivered impressive stats: a .267/.406/.613 slash line with 37 homers. While remarkable, these figures probably disappointed those who expected more from a Top 5 pick. Statcast ranks Judge at the absolute top of several metrics, including xwOBA, xSLG, avgEV, Barrel%, HardHit%, and BB%. Judge remains an offensive powerhouse, but some health risks put him at a better value as a second-round pick in 12-team leagues.",,2024
9,Fernando Tatis Jr.,SD,OF,9.0,7.0,Fernando Tatis Jr. (SD - OF),435,.276|100R|32HR|94RBI|28SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/fernando-tatis-jr.php,Tatis Jr.,".276|100R|32HR|94RBI|28SB
In 2023, Fernando Tatis Jr. showed a deceiving decline, batting .257/.322/.449 post-suspension. Yet, a deeper look reveals a promising expected slash line of .282/.332/.511, with a low BABIP (.299) impacting his performance. Tatis achieved a career-low strikeout rate (22.2%), hitting 25 homers and swiping 29 bases. A weaker team offense hinders him, so his overall stats don't reflect his potential. Avoiding off-field mishaps, Tatis, at 25, is a strong candidate for a significant rebound. He's a steal in drafts if available at a reduced price.",,2024
10,Shohei Ohtani,LAD,"DH,SP",10.0,104.0,"Shohei Ohtani (LAD - DH,SP)",493,".284|109R|39HR|104RBI|20SB

0-0-0SV|0.00|0.00|nanK9
Shohei Ohtani remains a fantasy giant, even if he is only a hitter in 2024. Despite playing for an underwhelming Angels team, he delivered 95 RBIs, 102 runs, 44 homers, and 20 steals in 135 games. His recovery from an elbow injury should mirror Bryce Harper's successful return, indicating minimal impact on his elite performance. Statcast ranks Ohtani in the top 98th percentile for batting run value, leading in barrel percentage, exit velocity, and expected slugging. The only concern is the trend of players underperforming after big free-agent deals, but Ohtani's exceptional skill set makes him a solid addition to fantasy lineups. There is a chance he could slip to the second round, which boosts his value even higher.",,2024
11,Juan Soto,NYY,OF,11.0,6.0,Juan Soto (NYY - OF),544,.285|110R|38HR|104RBI|11SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/juan-soto.php,Soto,".285|110R|38HR|104RBI|11SB
Juan Soto delivered an impressive 2023 season, overcoming a sluggish start to finish with 35 homers, 109 RBIs, 97 runs, and 12 steals. His outstanding .410 OBP and .519 slugging, highlighted by a stellar 18.6% walk rate, underscore his advanced plate discipline. Despite a slightly higher strikeout rate at 18.2%, Soto remains a top pick, particularly in OBP leagues. Chances are good that the 25-year-old will be playing somewhere other than San Diego before hitting free agency in 2025; however, he is easily a Top-10 draft pick in all fantasy formats.",,2024
12,Trea Turner,PHI,SS,12.0,11.0,Trea Turner (PHI - SS),402,.283|96R|23HR|82RBI|28SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/trea-turner.php,Turner,".283|96R|23HR|82RBI|28SB
Trea Turner struggled in his first season in Philadelphia, leading to the infamous game where his own mother booed him. He eventually turned it around and ended the season, slashing .266/.320/.459 with 102 runs, 76 RBIs, 26 home runs, and 30 stolen bases. Turner's baserunning value remains in the 99th percentile, according to Statcast, and many of his underlying metrics suggest improvement in the 2024 season. At this point, however, Turner's ADP is in the first round in NFBC leagues, and there may be better value elsewhere at shortstop this year.",,2024
13,Jose Ramirez,CLE,"3B,DH",13.0,12.0,"Jose Ramirez (CLE - 3B,DH)",515,.285|92R|28HR|95RBI|24SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/jose-ramirez.php,Ramirez,".285|92R|28HR|95RBI|24SB
Jose Ramirez turned in another stellar season in 2023, hitting 24 home runs and stealing 28 bases while slashing .282/.356/.475. His other counting stats took a hit due to a subpar lineup around him. He only knocked in 80 and scored 87 across 156 games. Ramirez will be in his age-31 season, typically a time when stolen bases begin to slow down, but his superb batting skills will continue to have high fantasy value. If Cleveland does not improve the lineup around him, he is a first-round talent in a later-round situation that will leave fantasy managers wanting more.",,2024
14,Spencer Strider,ATL,SP,14.0,13.0,Spencer Strider (ATL - SP),486,15-6-0SV|3.30|1.09|12.79K9,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/spencer-strider.php,Strider,"15-6-0SV|3.30|1.09|12.79K9
Spencer Strider performed as advertised in 2023. He struck out a ridiculous 281 batters in 186 2/3 innings for a 13.55 K/9. His walk rate dropped for the third straight season, and his xBAA was .205. His outlier was a 3.86 ERA, but don't let this stop you from drafting him, as his xERA was 3.09. Strider is currently the first pitcher off the board in NFBC drafts. He is neck-and-neck with Gerrit Cole for best fantasy SP1.",,2024
15,Matt Olson,ATL,1B,15.0,15.0,Matt Olson (ATL - 1B),484,.273|107R|42HR|116RBI|1SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/matt-olson.php,Olson,".273|107R|42HR|116RBI|1SB
Matt Olson's 2023 season marked a significant improvement over his 2022 performance. His batting average jumped from .240 to .283, and he saw a notable increase in his on-base percentage (OBP), going from .325 to .389. More impressively, Olson's slugging percentage (SLG) spiked to .604, substantially improving from his .477 in 2022. His home run count highlights this surge in power; he smashed 54 homers with 139 RBI, leading all of MLB. Additionally, Olson played in all 162 games for the formidable Atlanta Braves, a role he will return to in 2024. While Freddie Freeman offers better all-around numbers, Olson is the powerful corner infielder worth a second-round pick.",,2024
16,Yordan Alvarez,HOU,"DH,OF",16.0,14.0,"Yordan Alvarez (HOU - DH,OF)",471,.300|96R|38HR|109RBI|1SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/yordan-alvarez.php,Alvarez,".300|96R|38HR|109RBI|1SB
Despite missing 68 games in 2023, Yordan Alvarez showcased his exceptional batting skills. He posted a .293/.407/.583 line with 31 home runs and 97 RBIs, mirroring his 2022 RBI count in fewer games. Statcast ranks him in the 99th percentile for batting run value, underscoring his undeniable value in four fantasy categories. While his 18.5% strikeout rate is notable, his 13.9% walk rate compensates well. Alvarez is an excellent second-round choice for fantasy teams, especially if you're flexible with stolen bases.",,2024
17,Gerrit Cole,NYY,SP,17.0,16.0,Gerrit Cole (NYY - SP),460,14-8-0SV|3.54|1.12|10.29K9,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/gerrit-cole.php,Cole,"14-8-0SV|3.54|1.12|10.29K9
As Gerrit Cole enters the 2024 season at age 33, he continues to be a cornerstone of the New York Yankees' rotation. Cole made 33 starts last season, totaling 209.0 innings pitched and struck out 222 batters. He maintained an elite ace, allowing 157 hits and 48 walks, with a home run total of 20, reflecting his ability to limit long balls, a critical factor in his success. His K/9 of 9.56 was lower than the five seasons before, but that number is projected to get north of 10 again in 2024. While his age might raise concerns about potential decline, his 2023 season showed that Cole still possesses the skills to be a top-tier pitcher. He should still be one of the first two pitchers off the board (Spencer Strider).",,2024

Corey Seager had an outstanding 2023. His rankings in the American League in batting categories were a batting average of .327 (2nd), OBP of .390 (3rd), SLG of .623 (2nd), and OPS of 1.103 (2nd). Seager's power was on full display, as he smashed 33 home runs, tying him for 5th in the AL, and he led the league in doubles with 42. Even with slight regression in store, the 29-year-old offers exceptional power numbers from a tough position and should be a Top 3 shortstop off the board.",,2024

Austin Riley continued solidifying his position as the premier power-hitting third baseman in the National League during the 2023 season. He finished with a .281 batting average with 37 home runs and 97 RBIs. His slugging percentage stood at .516, contributing to an OPS of .861. Riley scored 27 more runs than the year before due to being in such a potent lineup. He doesn't walk much and strikes out more than we'd like. But Riley's ability to consistently hit for power while maintaining a reasonable batting average makes him a valuable asset in fantasy baseball, especially considering his position at third base.",,2024
20,Bryce Harper,PHI,"1B,DH",20.0,26.0,"Bryce Harper (PHI - 1B,DH)",434,.285|93R|29HR|93RBI|13SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/bryce-harper.php,Harper,".285|93R|29HR|93RBI|13SB
Bryce Harper returned triumphantly from elbow surgery in May instead of the predicted July and rewarded every fantasy manager who took a flier on him late in 2023 drafts. He played 126 games and remained an elite hitter in the majors, slashing .293/.401/.499 in the middle of a Phillies lineup that finished sixth in team OPS. Harper is now primarily a DH/1B, which should work just fine in fantasy leagues, and fantasy managers can anticipate a 30/90/90 season with double-digit steals (he stole 11 in '23). After Freddie Freeman is off the board, whether Matt Olson or Harper goes next is a coin flip. A full season of Bryce Harper is never a bad thing to have on your fantasy roster.",,2024
21,Rafael Devers,BOS,3B,21.0,19.0,Rafael Devers (BOS - 3B),448,.282|96R|35HR|99RBI|5SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/rafael-devers.php,Devers,".282|96R|35HR|99RBI|5SB
At 27 years old, Rafael Devers remains a linchpin in the Red Sox lineup. His 2023 season saw him at the plate 656 times, where he notched 157 hits, including 33 home runs and 100 RBIs, and scored 90 runs. His performance slightly dropped in batting average to .271 from .295 in 2022. Still, he maintained a solid on-base percentage of .351 and a slugging percentage of .500. Devers always seems to be overlooked in fantasy drafts. Still, he is a set-and-forget third baseman who will play 150+ games.",,2024
22,Marcus Semien,TEX,2B,22.0,22.0,Marcus Semien (TEX - 2B),424,.264|102R|27HR|80RBI|16SB,https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/players/marcus-semien.php,Semien,".264|102R|27HR|80RBI|16SB
Marcus Semien excelled in the 2023 season with a .276 batting average across 670 at-bats. He demonstrated notable power, hitting 28 home runs and driving in 100 RBIs. Over his career, Semien has a .258 average with 215 home runs and 120 stolen bases. For the 2024 season, fantasy managers can look to Semien for consistent power and run production in a powerful lineup that should get even better as the young hitters come into their own. His ability to contribute in multiple categories and projections in the 25 HR and 100 RBI range, along with double-digit steals, should make him the top 2B off the board after Mookie Betts.",,2024

After an injury-marred 2022 season, Ozzie Albies made a triumphant return in 2023, reasserting himself as one of the premier second basemen in the league. At just 26, Albies has already etched his name as a three-time All-Star and two-time Silver Slugger recipient. The 2023 season saw him play 148 games, boasting a robust 124 OPS+, and delivering a .280/.336/.513 slash line. Albies' power was on full display, with a career-high 33 home runs and 109 RBIs, part of his 68 extra-base hits. This marked improvement in power numbers was complemented by a more patient approach at the plate, evident in his on-base percentage. He also contributed 13 stolen bases. Albie's blend of power, speed, and defense makes him a top fantasy pick, especially at a position not typically known for such prolific power numbers.",,2024

In 2023, Alonso showcased his home run prowess, belting 46 to finish third in the majors. His batting average disintegrated to .217 from .271 in 2022, and his OBP cratered to .318 from .352. His run production remained high, with 92 runs scored and 118 RBIs over 658 plate appearances. Chances are good that Alonso's ratios will settle somewhere between his 2022 and 2023 numbers. If you're looking for monster counting stats from your first baseman, Alonso has you covered in three categories and most likely will be around in the third round.",,2024

Corbin Burnes is in the last year of his contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, and it would be somewhat surprising if he still plays for them at the end of the year. The important thing to note is that his pending free agency makes him an even better draft pick in 2024 than usual. And his ""usual"" is still elite. Burnes landed at 200 strikeouts in 193 2/3 innings with a 3.39 ERA and microscopic 1.07 WHIP. Hitters struggle to make good contact on Burnes's pitches (avgEV of 86.4), but his K% dropped five percent to 25.5. As the third pitcher in Tier 1, he has the most to gain in 2024 and will make an excellent SP1 in fantasy.",,2024

Francisco Lindor had the quietest 31-homer season in recent memory. He also stole 31 bases, scored 108 runs, and drove in 98. To put this in perspective, among shortstops who played 20 games at the position, Lindor's ranks are as follows: Home runs (2nd), runs (1st), RBI (1st), and stolen bases (7th). His incredible fantasy year was buried under the Mets' real-life struggles and underperformance, but make no mistake about it. Lindor is a Top 5 shortstop who is perceived as much lower. Take advantage of the discount if it is available in your leagues.",,2024

Zack Wheeler continued his SP1 ways in 2023, racking up 212 strikeouts in 192 innings. His ERA was a little high (for him) at 3.61, and his xFIP supported that at 3.54. Wheeler is in the 95th percentile in BB% (5.0), so you can draft him knowing he will protect your WHIP better than many other aces. He also started 32 games, making his durability an asset as well. Wheeler remains at the top of Tier 2 after the Strider/Cole/Burnes triad, and you can probably get him in the third round.",,2024

In 2023, Luis Robert Jr. finally delivered on his potential, playing 145 games and hitting .264 with 38 homers, 20 steals, 90 runs, and 80 RBIs. Despite Chicago's weak lineup, Robert's performance was a bright spot, showcasing his power-speed blend vital for fantasy outfielders. His limited walks (5.0 BB%) and injury history remain concerns, but his healthy season boosts his draft appeal for 2024.",,2024

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. played 156 games and raised his walk rate while lowering his strikeout rate. Those were the highlights. Unfortunately, his other numbers took a fall across the board. The good news for 2024 is that Vladdy's expected numbers were more in line with what fantasy managers were looking for when they drafted him. For his age-25 season, he should see a bounce back to mid-30s in homers and close to 100/100 in runs and RBIs. The biggest discrepancy was his .264 average compared to his xBA of .295. Vladdy should be an asset, but he is now a Round 3 or 4 guy.",,2024

Kevin Gausman had a great second season north of the border, pitching 185 innings and striking out 237. His 11.53 K/9 was the second-highest of his career, but his walk rate went back up to 7.2% from his career low in 2022 (3.9). He has a couple of questionable metrics, namely his 3.87 xERA compared to his actual 3.16 ERA. His xFIP ended at 3.22, though, so chances are good that number will settle somewhere in the middle. His 31.1% strikeout rate might come back down to earth a little as well. Gausman is a good SP1 from Tier 2.",,2024

Michael Harris II finished with a .293/.331/.477 slash line, along with 18 homers, 76 runs, and 20 steals. Positioned as the starting center fielder for 2024 with minimal competition, Harris, despite potential bust predictions, offers valuable five-category contributions for fantasy teams. He's not an exciting OF1, but he'll fit the bill if you wait a few rounds.",,2024

Gunnar Henderson had an atrocious start to the 2023 season. He ended April with a .189 batting average and 29 strikeouts in 92 plate appearances, and May wasn't much better. In June, however, the stud prospect version appeared, and fantasy managers everywhere were rewarded for their patience. Henderson should continue his growth in his second full year in the majors, and a powerful Orioles lineup should keep his counting stats up. He is going to cost you, but the rewards could be league-winning.",,2024

Jose Altuve began the season dealing with an injury he sustained in the World Baseball Classic. Upon his return, he delivered a stellar .311 batting average and .915 OPS in the 2023 season over 360 at-bats. His 14 home runs and 51 RBIs showcased his power, while 14 stolen bases highlighted his agility on the basepaths. Altuve's career stats, with a .307 average, 209 home runs, and 293 stolen bases, emphasize his long-term consistency and multi-dimensional play​​​​. In the 2023 postseason, he maintained a solid .286 average, adding to his reputation for performing in high-pressure situations. Altuve remains a prime fantasy pick in 2024, offering reliability in batting average and diverse category contributions.",,2024

Luis Castillo had a successful first season in Seattle, which was to be expected when he got out of Great American Ball Park. Castillo struck out 219 batters in 197 innings and started 33 games for the Mariners, striking out 10.01 K/9 and a 27.3 K%. One negative on his report card was his xERA of 3.82 and xFIP of 3.81, suggesting his 3.34 ERA may have been a bit lucky. Also of note was his 1.28 HR/9, which was the highest it had been since 2018. There is a lot to like about Castillo, but he is one of the more volatile pitchers in Tier 2.",,2024

Bo Bichette had a down year in 2023, which kept him in line with more than one of his Blue Jays teammates. He batted .306, albeit with an inflated .355 BABIP, and hit 20 home runs. However, he scored only 69 runs and knocked in 73. He only swiped five bags in a year when stolen bases went up across the board. Since counting stats in the lineup are dependent on production around him, Bichette should see a bounceback in 2024 and land somewhere in the 90/90 range. The 25-year-old will help with batting average and could end up a steal in the fourth round, but the allure of him having first-round value is no more.",,2024

Randy Arozarena stands out for his reliable performance, appearing in over 140 games for three consecutive seasons and achieving a 20/20 in each. While he has a solid walk rate of 12.2%, his batting average and strikeout rate rank in the 35th percentile. While these stats limit his reach as a comprehensive fantasy contributor, his power at the plate is undeniable. Arozarena is a dependable choice, and fantasy managers can bank on another 20/20 season in 2024.",,2024

Elly De La Cruz might be the most exciting and riskiest player on the board. He has a ton of potential that he occasionally flashed in his rookie season. For instance, he stole 35 bases in only 98 games and is in the 100th percentile in sprint speed at 30.5. He also hit the ball hard... when he hit it. His K%, Whiff%, and Chase% are all in the ""highly undesirable"" range, which drove his OBP down to .300. The primary question for fantasy managers is: When do you believe he will figure out major league pitching? De La Cruz's minor league stats suggest that day will come, and as part of Cincinnati's wave of the future, the 21-year-old will have a very long leash to figure things out in 2024. If you want his potential on your fantasy team, you will have to grab him earlier than you probably want. I'd stay away from him until the fifth round in 2024.",,2024

In 2023, Adolis Garcia smashed 39 home runs, notched 107 RBIs, and scored 106 runs, contributing significantly to his team's World Series victory. Although his stolen bases dipped to nine, his impressive stats in xSLG, AvgEV, Barrel%, and Hard Hit% show no signs of decline. Fantasy managers should be cautious during drafts, as his excellent postseason performance could inflate his value. Now a robust three-category player, Garcia is a complex but potentially rewarding pick.",,2024

Pablo Lopez had a great first year in Minnesota and established himself as their SP1. He threw 194 innings and struck out 234 batters. Lopez ended the season with a 3.86 ERA and 1.18, but his xERA was much lower at 3.00 with an xFIP of 3.25. Statcast has him ranked in the 98th percentile of pitching run value, and he may come at a small discount compared to where his projections have him. Lopez isn't a flashy SP1 for fantasy managers, but he offers stellar stats and consistency, which ain't bad.",,2024

George Kirby has a lot of stats to love, but the one that jumps off the page is that he walked 19 batters in 190 2/3 innings. He struck out 172 batters and carried a 3.35 ERA with 1.04 WHIP. Both his xERA and xFIP were higher than his actual numbers, but he started 31 games, and there is nothing overtly alarming in his underlying metrics. Kirby will cost you a fourth or fifth-round pick in 2024, but there is no better anchor for your ratios.",,2024

Zac Gallen had a dominant 2023 and finished third in the NL Cy Young race. The 28-year-old tossed 210 innings and struck out 220 with a 3.47 ERA and 1.11 WHIP. If we include the postseason, Gallen threw 243 2/3 innings, 60 innings more than his previous high. He gave up a lot of hard contact, and his xERA was 4.16. Gallen's xFIP was 3.49 on the plus side, and he continued to strike out more than one batter per inning. Gallen is a risky SP1, and his cost (currently in the third round) looks pretty high, given all the red flags heading into 2024.",,2024

CJ Abrams showed remarkable progress in the 2023 season. At just 23, Abrams became a significant asset for fantasy baseball managers, especially for his speed on the bases. In the 2023 regular season, Abrams showcased his potential by hitting .245 with 18 home runs and 64 RBIs over 563 at-bats. His OPS stood at .712. Abrams' real value, however, lies in his base-stealing abilities. He swiped 47 bases, ranking 3rd in the NL, and this aspect of his game will be particularly valuable in fantasy leagues where stolen bases are a premium. Heading into the 2024 season, fantasy managers should consider Abrams a high-upside player, particularly for stolen bases and runs scored, with potential for batting average and power growth. His youth and displayed talent suggests that he could continue to develop into an even more impactful player in the coming years.",,2024

Paul Goldschmidt continued to do what he does, albeit at a lesser pace than his torrid 2022. He hit 25 home runs, scored 89 runs, knocked in 80, and stole 11 bases. He continued to be a picture of stability, playing in over 150 games for the eighth year in a row (excluding 2020). His batting average tumbled from .317 to .268, and his slugging fell to .447 from .578. Essentially, the regression that we expected hit, yet he still had an overall productive season. Looking ahead, fantasy managers can probably expect numbers in line with 2023, but he does not need to be drafted before the seventh round in 2024.",,2024

Cody Bellinger notably outperformed expectations with a .307/.356/.525 slash line against a predicted .270/.331/.437. Currently a free agent, Bellinger presents a challenge for fantasy managers, with caution advised due to the typical decline following a standout season.

Nolan Jones made a significant impact in the 2023 season, showcasing his power and speed as a 20/20 player in Colorado. With an impressive .297/.389/.542 slash line and a strong Barrel% of 15.7, Jones is a reliable source of power and on-base ability (xwOBACON .475). However, his high .401 BABIP suggests his batting average might decline. Despite a high strikeout rate around 30%, Jones's combination of power, walks, and 15-20 stolen bases, especially in Coors Field, makes him a valuable fantasy asset, albeit with a potential downside in batting average.",,2024

Tyler Glasnow returned with a vengeance in 2023. Upon his return from Tommy John surgery, he threw 120 innings and struck out 162 batters. His 33.4 K% is in the 97th percentile, and his fastball velocity sat in the 96-mph range. His ERA was 3.53, but his xFIP was 2.75, suggesting that he dealt with some bad luck. (And if you know Glasnow, you know that he has dealt with a lot of bad luck in his career.) His WHIP also remained low at 1.08. Now, he joins a burgeoning SuperTeam in the Dodgers, where he will remain for the foreseeable future. He offers so much strikeout upside that it doesn't really matter where he plays. He would be in my Tier 1 of pitchers except for his injury history, which knocks him down ever so slightly.",,2024

Tarik Skubal arrived in 2023 and quickly became the Detroit ace. He started 15 games for the Tigers, throwing 80 1/3 innings and striking out 102 batters. More impressively, he ended with a 2.80 ERA and 0.90 WHIP. On top of that, his xERA was 2.30, and his xFIP was 2.56, which suggests that his production was not an aberration. Looking ahead to 2024, Skubal slots in as an SP2 with an SP1 ceiling that is hard to ignore. He is worth targeting in the fourth or fifth rounds of drafts.",,2024

Adley Rutschman arrived in 2023 in a big way. He slashed .277/.374/.435 and hit 20 home runs, drove in 80, and scored 84 times. The upstart Orioles offense is loaded with weapons, and the 26-year-old should continue to bat at the top of it. He will never steal bases, but he will protect your ratios better than any other catcher on the board. Don't be surprised when he is the first backstop drafted in 2024.",,2024

Devin Williams saved 36 games in 2023 and struck out 87 in 58 2/3 innings. He had a sparkling ERA of 1.53, though this was somewhat misleading, with an xERA of 2.75 and an xFIP of 2.79. Williams consistently gives up more walks than fantasy managers would like, but we forgive him due to his 99th percentile K% (37.7 in 2023). Even with the walks, he finished with a 0.92 WHIP. He should be the top reliever taken in 2024.",,2024

Aaron Nola had a mixed bag of results for fantasy teams in 2023. He threw 193 2/3 innings across 32 starts, so durability was not an issue. He struck out 202 batters and maintained his excellent BB% (5.7) for a WHIP of 1.15. His ERA, however, was an unseemly 4.46, and he gave up a career-high 1.49 HR/9. Nola's xERA and xFIP suggest improvement in ERA for 2024, and he has started precisely 32 games each of the last three seasons. In the offseason, he signed a seven-year, $172 million contract with the Phillies, a significant deal for a guy who will turn 31 in June. The perception of Nola is that he is an SP1, but his stats suggest grabbing someone to anchor your staff in 2024 and slot him in as an SP2.",,2024

Manny Machado had a down year by his standards and by the standards of fantasy managers who took him early in 2023 drafts. In 138 games, he hit 30 home runs and drove in 91, which is in line with his career average. However, his batting average (.258) and OBP (.319) did not hold up their end of the bargain. Of course, neither did the Padres All-Star lineup. According to Statcast, he is right around average in Batting Run Value, which should drop his draft cost considerably, and his counting numbers may not hold steady with the departure of Juan Soto in the offseason. When you take into consideration the overall increase in talent at 3B and couple it with an aging Machado (he will turn 32 in July), there may be better value on the board in 2024.",,2024

Matt McLain played 89 games for the Reds in 2023 and arrived with a bang. He hit 16 home runs and stole 14 bases while slashing an impressive .290/.357/.507. As with many rookies, he struggled with strikeouts, racking up 115 of them. McLain's expected stats leave something to be desired (xBA of 2.56 and xSLG of .436), but assuming growth in his sophomore season and batting in a hitter's haven make the 24-year-old a high-upside pick in the fifth or sixth round.",,2024

Yoshinobu Yamamoto will arrive in MLB with the powerhouse Dodgers in 2024, and while there may be an adjustment period for the 25-year-old, it shouldn't last too long. Yamamoto should come close to 200 strikeouts, though his ERA is projected to be near 4.00. However, as with all pitchers on outstanding teams, he does have slightly more win equity than others. As part of the $1 billion package that Los Angeles dropped on Yamamoto and Shohei Ohtani, the former's ADP seems somewhat inflated for a pitcher who has yet to face MLB hitters. He will cost you a sixth-round draft pick, and there may be better value elsewhere that early.",,2024

Jazz Chisholm's 2022 season with the Miami Marlins was limited to 97 games due to injuries. Despite this, he showcased his talent with 19 home runs and 22 stolen bases. His advanced metrics indicated struggles, notably with a high strikeout rate over 30% and a drop in walk rate. Chisholm also experienced a decrease in sprint speed, ranking in the 78th percentile, likely impacted by a turf toe injury, which was surgically addressed in October. Looking ahead to 2024, if he stays healthy, Chisholm has the potential to achieve over 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, along with 70-80 RBIs and runs. However, he will no longer be eligible as a second baseman, affecting his versatility in fantasy lineups.",,2024

Royce Lewis is the latest Minnesota Twin to offer superstar-level stats with an unfortunate injury-prone profile. In 58 games last season, Lewis smacked 15 home runs, drove in 52 runs, and slashed .309/.372/.548. His average was inflated (xBA .265), but the power is very real. The 24-year-old's xwOBACON is .410; even though his xSLG was lower, it was still .476. An entire season of Lewis has first-round upside, but fantasy managers should draft him expecting fewer games. With a bit of luck, Lewis avoids becoming Byron Buxton 2.0, and those who draft him will be rewarded handsomely.",,2024

In 2023, Freddy Peralta finished sixth in K/9 among qualified starting pitchers who threw 100 or more innings. He struck out 210 batters in only 165 2/3 innings across 30 starts. His ERA was high at 3.86, but his xERA was 3.35, and his xFIP was 3.42. Peralta occasionally gives up hard contact, and his 1.4 HR/9 isn't great, but his 3.89 K/BB ratio was good for the 23rd-best in the majors. He will turn 28 in June, and even though he threw the most innings of his career last year, there isn't much to be concerned about.

He struck out 194 batters in 216 innings pitched, so while he is not the strikeout artist of an SP1, he will do wonders for your ratios. And if you're interested in a durable starter, Webb started 33 games last year and 32 games the year before.

Mike Trout's performance in 2023 showcased his exceptional hitting abilities, though injuries limited him to just 82 games. Averaging slightly over 100 games annually since 2016 (excluding the 2020 shortened season), Trout's recent playing time has been inconsistent, with 82, 119, and 36 games in the last three seasons. His .263/.367/.490 slash line last season reflected a dip that can likely be attributed to a wrist injury. At 32, Trout's base-stealing days are behind him, with only 17 steals in the past five years. Additionally, his lineup may no longer include Shohei Ohtani. While a fully healthy Trout could warrant a first or second-round fantasy pick, relying on his full-season availability is risky. Trout remains a viable OF1, but drafting him as an OF2 with a plan for potential absences might be more prudent.",,2024

Framber Valdez took a step back in 2023 but still pitched 198 innings of stellar ball for the Astros. He ended with a 3.46 ERA, though his 4.33 xERA suggests he was lucky. On the other hand, his xFIP was 3.39, and he was one of 17 pitchers who struck out 200 or more. Valdez remains a cheat code in leagues with Quality Starts as a category. Even in traditional 5x5 leagues, he is an excellent SP2 with SP1 upside that you can probably get in the fifth round.",,2024

Max Fried dealt with a couple of injuries in 2023, which limited him to 14 starts and 77 2/3 innings. He made the most of those innings, though, with a 2.55 ERA and 1.13 WHIP. While fantasy managers shouldn't chase wins, Fried's 8-1 record is notable because of the team he plays for. If he continues with his current pitching profile (Pitching Run-Value of 88, according to Statcast), the wins should come thanks to the prolific Braves offense. Fried does not give up much in the way of hard hits, and his ground ball percentage of 59.2 lands in the 97th percentile. He will be a solid SP1 if you wait until the fifth or sixth round to start your pitching staff.",,2024

Emmanuel Clase led all of baseball with 44 saves, and he did so with a 7.93 K/9. His secret is a GB% of 56.6, which is in the 93rd percentile. His ERA, however, took a precipitous jump from 1.36 to 3.22. If you're planning to use an early-round draft pick on a closer, there are three Tier 1 guys before Clase, who seems a bit more of a risk in 2024.",,2024

Josh Hader experienced the bounceback foretold last offseason. He dropped his ERA from 5.22 to 1.28, which was much more in line with his career numbers. He struck out 85 batters in 56 1/3 innings and collected 33 saves. His elite xBA of .157 is in the 100th percentile, and batters have yet to figure out how to get any barrel on the Southpaw's pitches. Hader's downfall will always be his BB% (13.0), but fantasy managers inclined to take a closer early in drafts should feel confident they're getting one of the top two here.",FA,2024

Kyle Schwarber is one of the most predictable players in fantasy baseball. He will hit bombs (40+). He will score runs (100+). He is going to drive in teammates (100+). And he will absolutely crater your batting average (.197 in 2023). These stats seem like a ""The sun rises in the East"" type of guarantee. Schwarber does get on base, thanks to a 17.5% walk rate, and he continued to hit atop a powerful Phillies batting order. You just need to decide if you're punting the average category before you take him because you don't get to be surprised by it later.",,2024

In 2023, Josh Lowe emerged as a fantasy gem, especially for those lucky enough to snag him off waivers. Lowe significantly bolstered fantasy lineups by contributing a solid .273/.323/.457 slash line, 20 homers, and 32 steals. His metrics indicate this performance wasn't a fluke, with high percentile rankings in expected batting average, slugging, and sprint speed. Looking ahead, Lowe shows promise for another 20/20 season, making him a valuable second or third outfielder in fantasy leagues that you can get in the seventh round.",,2024

In 2023, Christian Yelich bounced back impressively, showcasing a potent mix of power and speed with 19 homers, 106 runs, 76 RBIs, and 28 steals. His .278 batting average matched his expected average, underlined by a top-tier Hard-Hit% in the 93rd percentile. Yelich's on-base skills shone, too, reaching a .370 OBP, partly thanks to the new shift rules. Despite a less-than-stellar Brewers lineup, he surpassed 100 runs, a trend likely to continue in 2024. While nagging back issues are a concern, a healthy Yelich offers strong outfield value, fitting comfortably as an OF3 with potential for more.",,2024

Nico Hoerner impressed in 2023 with a .283 batting average and 43 stolen bases, highlighting his speed and versatility. Earning a Rawlings NL Gold Glove, he excelled defensively while being a consistent offensive contributor, scoring 98 runs and amassing 175 hits. His ability to consistently reach base reflected in 688 plate appearances, and his prowess on the basepaths make him a valuable fantasy asset. Going into 2024, Hoerner is poised to continue his multi-category contributions, with a particular emphasis on stolen bases and runs, making him a solid pick in fantasy baseball.",,2024

Blake Snell won the 2023 NL Cy Young Award, but will come with plenty of risk in 2024. As of right now, we don't know where he will be, which is part of the battle, but his 2.25 ERA last year was a mirage. Snell's xERA was 3.77, and xFIP was 3.62. In the positive column, he struck out 234 batters in 180 innings and was one of only 11 qualified starters with an 11 K/9 or higher. If walks drive you crazy, don't even consider the 31-year-old, but if you need strikeouts and plan to have ratio help elsewhere, Snell can be a nice SP2.",FA,2024

In his first season in MLB, Kodai Senga struck out 202 batters in 166 1/3 innings. He had an impressive 29.1 K% and 2.98 ERA. However, his xERA was almost an entire run higher (3.87), and his BB% was a disappointing 11.1. Fantasy managers should expect more of the same in 2024. He will strike out around 10 per nine, but walks and home runs will remain problematic. Senga falls right in that early-middle rounds window, where he is much more appealing as long as you have already grabbed your SP1.",,2024

Oneil Cruz suffered another ankle injury in 2023, which limited him to only nine games, though he did steal three bases in that small sample. Cruz has all the talent in the world, but recurrent ankle injuries pose a risk going forward. He will be 25 years old during the 2024 season, so there is still plenty of time for the former top prospect to turn his career around. The question is whether or not you're willing to pay the cost to take that chance.",,2024

Logan Gilbert pitched 190 2/3 innings, struck out 189 batters, and ended with a 3.73 ERA and 1.08 WHIP. The 26-year-old offered an elite BB% of 4.7, and his xERA and xFIP are in line with his actual numbers. Gilbert has started 32 games in each of the last two years, so the durability is there. He has an average K% and Whiff%, which keeps him out of an elite SP tier, but he is a solid SP3 with SP2 upside for those who want to take that risk.",,2024

J.T. Realmuto's run as the clear No. 1 catcher in fantasy may be over. Realmuto's batting average and OBP have fallen to below-average, and he may fall in the Phillies batting order as a result.

Will Christian Walker remain a sleeper first baseman for the third year in a row, or are people finally onto his production? The 32-year-old hit 33 home runs and drove in 103 while slashing .258/.333/.497 for an exciting Arizona lineup. Walker has an impressive K% (19.2) and xwOBACON (.380), and he has also remained healthy, playing 160 games in 2022 and 157 last year. While he is not a full sleeper in 2024, he is still the cheapest of the top 1B options, going in the fifth or sixth round in most drafts.

Eury Perez started 19 games for the Marlins and gave every fantasy manager a glimpse of how incredible he could be. He struck out 108 in 91 1/3 innings with a 3.15 ERA and 1.13. His fastball velocity sits in the 94th percentile at 97.5, and he had a 33.7 Whiff%. Batters had a difficult time with his breaking stuff, but they touched up his four-seamer more than ideal. Expect Perez's ERA to jump a notch into the 3.80 to 4.00 range, but he should continue striking out 10 per nine. Hopefully, the 20-year-old can limit the hard contact and home runs in 2024, but he is definitely in SP2 territory.",,2024

I think it's fair to say that Grayson Rodriguez stumbled onto the scene in 2023. In the first half of the season, the rookie threw 45 1/3 innings and gave up 13 home runs and 21 walks on his way to a 7.35 ERA and a trip back to Triple-A. When he returned, the prospect everyone wanted to see arrived. He allowed only three home runs over his final 76 2/3 innings and finished that half with a 2.58 ERA. The good news is that the 24-year-old's second season should be more in line with the latter half of 2023. With a 94th percentile (97.4 mph) fastball velocity, Rodriguez is best considered an SP3 with an SP2 upside in 2024.",,2024

Will Smith has become an Ol' Reliable of the catching position in fantasy baseball. He only played in 126 games, which suppressed his home run total (19) to below 20 for the first time since 2020. Smith hits in the middle of the powerful Dodgers lineup, and his counting stats should continue being boosted because of it. His Statcast hitting profile shows that he excels at patience, though his batting average will hover in the .260 range.

Alex Bregman will turn 30 in 2024, and yet, he just keeps plugging away at the hot corner in Houston. He actually improved on all of his 2022 stats last season, hitting 25 homers, knocking in 98, and crossing the plate 103 times. His consistency in ratios is impressive, and fantasy managers can expect numbers in the ballpark of .265/.365/.450. He doesn't strike out and mashes lefties. Bregman is the overlooked-because-he's-boring guy that you can steal in the ninth round or later, and he should be well worth the pick.",,2024

Before 2023, Zach Eflin received an abundance of ""sleeper"" predictions because of the Tampa Bump. Pitchers going TO the Rays are targets. Pitchers going away from them are typically labeled busts. It was difficult to believe a guy with a career ERA over 4.00 would suddenly be worth chasing. Alas, Eflin bought into his hype, apparently. He had a career-high K/9 of 9.42, striking out 186 batters in 177 2/3 innings. He ended with an ERA of 3.50, and his xFIP of 3.12 suggests he was even better than that. His WHIP was 1.02 thanks to a BB% of 3.4 and a Chase% of 34. Eflin's 2024 outlook suggests some regression but nothing to scare fantasy managers away from his SP3 draft price.",,2024

Entering the 2024 season, Ha-Seong Kim has established himself as a valuable asset for fantasy baseball managers. At 28 years old, Kim's versatility on the field is evident with his multi-positional eligibility. His performance in 2023 was impressive, as he racked up 84 runs, 140 hits, 17 home runs, and an exceptional 38 stolen bases, ranking fifth in the NL for steals. This was a significant increase from his 12 stolen bases in 2022. Kim had 626 plate appearances and 538 at-bats during the season, highlighting his consistent presence in the lineup. His advanced metrics indicate an increased comfort at the plate, reflected in his improved walk and strikeout rates and his on-base plus slugging (OPS) reaching .749. Kim's blend of speed, improving power, and position versatility make him a strong asset for fantasy teams.

Triston Casas is the next star at the first base position. He took a leap in 2023 at the age of 23, hitting 24 home runs in 132 games with an impressive slash line of .263/.367/.490. He is in the 93rd percentile of BB% at 13.9 and the 92nd percentile in xwOBA at .370. His counting stats weren't great, only tallying 65 RBIs and 66 runs, but this should improve with the return of some key Boston players.

Bryan Reynolds, consistently selected in the 8th or 9th rounds, delivers reliable value in those slots. Though his batting average has dipped below .270 in recent seasons, he maintains steady on-base skills with a potential for over 20 homers annually. His 12 stolen bases last season reflect adaptability to new baserunning rules, offering a well-rounded fantasy profile.

Bobby Miller throws hard. He has a fastball velocity in the 98th percentile (98.9 mph), and the speed did not transfer to a high Whiff%. The 24-year-old started 22 games for the Dodgers, and he should have no issue sliding into their 2024 rotation. And it won't be hard to justify anyone wearing a Dodgers uniform this year. His ERA is projected to sit around 4.00, but the win equity and solid pitching organization give him slightly more upside. If you feel the need for speed, he's your guy.

He had a respectable ERA of 2.90, but the WHIP moved to 1.22, a full two-tenths higher than his 2022 number.

Gleyber Torres rewarded fantasy managers who took a chance on him in 2023. He hit 25 home runs, stole 13 bases, and scored 90 runs in an offense that lacked Aaron Judge for two-thirds of the season. Now that Juan Soto is in tow, Torres should creep to the century mark in runs, and he no longer comes with the baggage of a bad K%. He reduced his strikeout rate from 22.6 percent to 14.6, and he used that increased contact to raise his batting average to .273 (xBA .283) and his OBP to .347 without losing anything in his slugging.

Heading into his age-26 season, he is stretched out and ready to throw 180+ innings in 2024.

Raisel Iglesias finished in the Top 10 in saves with 33 last season. This number might seem low, but the Atlanta Braves didn't have many save opportunities while routinely blowing out opponents. Iglesias remains elite in Chase% (35.4), but batters lit up his fastball and sinker more than in past seasons. Iglesias will remain a Tier 2 closer because of the team he plays for, but look out for that to continue to be a double-edged sword when it comes to saves. There are other relievers with more ratio upside later in the draft.",,2024

Joe Ryan started 29 games for the Twins last year, ending up with an ERA (4.51) that was almost a full run higher than in 2022 (3.55). His xERA last year, though, was 3.53, and chances are good that he was just snakebit by a .305 BABIP. He also gave up a lot of hard contact (1.78 HR/9), but he struck out 197 batters and walked fewer than two per game. He should bounce back nicely in 2024, and you can draft him in the ninth round to be your SP2 or SP3.",,2024

Josh Jung played 121 games for the World Series champs in 2023, and he arrived in fashion. The 25-year-old hit 23 home runs, scored 75 runs, knocked in 70, and slashed .266/.316/.467. Jung is in the 98th percentile in Sweet-Spot% at 41.9, but he struggled in typical rookie fashion with strikeouts (29.3 K%) and plate discipline (5.8 BB%). If he can get to that 150-game mark, he will land in the ballpark of 30 home runs and 100 RBIs. Not too shabby for a third baseman currently going ninth round of drafts.",,2024

Kyle Bradish had an excellent 2023 campaign. He struck out 168 batters in 168 2/3 innings, with a beautiful 2.83 ERA and 1.04 WHIP. He should come with a bit of a warning for 2024, though. His xERA was 3.82, and a low .270 BABIP added a heavy filter to his Insta-worthy stats. Bradish's four-seam fastball got lit up by batters (.563 SLG), and he will need that to improve to accompany his elite slider, which induced a 36.4 Whiff%. Chances are high he will go before the eighth round in your drafts, but reaching earlier than that is risky.",,2024

Nick Castellanos, with his consistent power, is a solid pick for an OF2/3 in 2024. Last year, he belted 29 homers, notched 106 RBIs, scored 79 runs, and swiped 11 bases, all while maintaining a .272 average. At 31, his low walk rate (5.4%) and high chase rate (41%) persist, but his spot in a potent lineup featuring Bryce Harper and a revitalized Trea Turner should help him maintain near 100 RBIs. Castellanos is a wise middle-round selection, especially for RBI contributions.",,2024

Spencer Torkelson hit 31 home runs and drove in 94, and his ISO went from .117 to .213 in 2023. He ranked in the 94th percentile in hard-hit percentage at 50.9, and he should be in line for another 30/90 season in 2024.

Spencer Steer is expected to be eligible for 1B/3B/OF, and possibly even 2B in some formats. With a solid 2023 season of 156 games, 23 homers, and 15 steals for the Reds, Steer is a promising fantasy pick. Batting in the middle of an exciting lineup with huge potential, he's on track to surpass his 86 RBI from last year. While not standing out in advanced metrics, Steer's consistent performance offers value in Round 9 and beyond, and the fact he plays half his games at Great American Ballpark is a plus for fantasy managers.",,2024

Alexis Diaz finished second in the National League with 37 saves and had a 3.07 ERA and 1.19 WHIP. He also struck out 86 batters in 67 1/3 innings, and he held opponents to an xBA of .192. The knocks against Diaz are that he was in the sixth percentile in BB% at 12.6, and he pitches in Cincinnati, which always feels like playing with fire. The 27-year-old is a step away from being in the upper tier of closers, but he will provide plenty of saves if you can tolerate the walks.",,2024

Ketel Marte posted a .276 batting average, hit 25 home runs, and contributed 82 RBIs over 150 games. He also notched 94 runs, eight stolen bases, and an OPS of .843. While his power and hitting haven't always peaked simultaneously, his overall performance, including an OPS+ over 100 in the last five full MLB seasons, underscores his reliability. Marte's overall hitting profile lands in the 90th percentile on Statcast. He should continue batting near the top of an exciting Arizona lineup, and another 20/90/80 season should be on its way.",,2024

Evan Carter, at just 21, swiftly ascended through the Rangers' farm system, spending minimal time in Triple-A before his major league debut. In his brief 2023 stint with 75 plate appearances, he showed potential. Projected as the starting left fielder, Carter could hit around 15 homers and steal 20 bases, thanks to his solid on-base abilities.

Edwin Diaz was in line for another stellar campaign when a patellar tendon tear ended his season during the World Baseball Classic. We'll just run it back for 2024, though, as Diaz's Statcast page shows that he leads the world in almost every pitching metric. The 29-year-old probably won't come with much of a discount in 2024, and the latest reports are that he is fully healthy. Diaz is a minimal-risk, extremely-high reward reliever.",,2024

During the 2023 season, Lane Thomas surpassed expectations with 28 home runs, 20 stolen bases, and 101 runs, emerging as a surprise fantasy asset from the waiver wire. However, a high .325 BABIP inflated his .268 average, well above his career norm. Projections for 2024 suggest a respectable 20 homers and 15 steals, but a modest .310 OBP could limit his overall fantasy impact. Caution is advised in drafting him, as his inflated 2023 performance may lead to an overvalued pick in early rounds.",,2024

In 2023, Seiya Suzuki found his groove with the Cubs, showcasing the skills fantasy managers anticipated in 2022. At 29, he presents a balanced offensive profile, combining a solid batting average with respectable power. His discerning eye at the plate (19.8% Chase rate) and solid walk rate (10.1%) add to his value.

Joe Musgrove dealt with an injury-plagued 2023, where he started only 17 games for the underperforming Padres. He pitched 97 1/3 innings and struck out 97 batters with a 3.05 ERA and 1.14 WHIP. The 31-year-old pitcher remains in the 90th percentile in BB% at 5.3, but his K% has decreased in each year since 2020.

Walker Buehler missed all of the 2023 following Tommy John surgery. He is a question mark heading into 2024. In 2021, he looked like the dominant pitcher everyone expected him to be, only to crater in 2022 with the injury. The argument for drafting Buehler as an SP3 is that he pitches for the Dodgers (stadium + team = good things) and becomes a free agent after the season. Many pitchers experience a ""honeymoon"" period following TJ surgery, and it could be a savvy move to grab him in the mid-rounds. The knock against him is that he will turn 30 in July, and his track record has been anything but consistent. It is a dice roll that can pay off for the right price.",,2024

At age 33, George Springer played in 154 games, marking a high since 2016. While achieving his first 20/20 season, Springer's hitting showed notable dips with career lows in batting average (.258), OBP (.327), and SLG (.405). His Statcast data reveals an average performance, except in Chase% and K%. Springer remains a crucial player atop the potent Blue Jays lineup, expected to regain power but lose a few stolen bases.

Xander Bogaerts signed an 11-year contract with the Padres to join what looked like a deep lineup but turned out to be disappointing. The 31-year-old had 19 home runs and 19 stolen bases (a career-high), but his other counting stats took a hit. He slashed .285/.350/.440, but his expected slash numbers were .255/.318/.401.

Justin Steele was in the NL Cy Young conversation for much of the 2023 season, finishing fifth when all was said and done. The 28-year-old had an elite BB% (5.0), and batters struggled to barrel up his pitches. He has hovered in the 24% K-rate for each of his three seasons, but last year's 1.17 WHIP is due for some regression in 2024.

Bryson Stott took quite the leap in 2023, richly rewarding fantasy managers who probably grabbed him on waivers. He played in 151 games, smacking 15 home runs and stealing 31 bases. He scored 78 runs, knocked in 62, and slashed .280/.329/.419. How much can this production be trusted going forward? The 15 HR and 25+ SB are sustainable, but fantasy managers should expect a drop in batting average, though not to an extreme degree. Second base looks a little shallow this season, leaving Stott as an acceptable 2B1 who you can get in the ninth round or later.",,2024

Yandy Diaz broke out of his power deficiency in a big way in 2023. After hitting only nine home runs in 2022, the 32-year-old smacked 22 dingers while slashing .330/.410/.522 in 2023. He rescued many fantasy managers who waited too long on 3B in drafts by setting career highs across 137 games. That's the good news. The bad news is that Diaz will probably return to his regularly scheduled self in 2024, and he no longer has 3B eligibility in most leagues, leaving him among the middle-rounds first basemen. Drafting him in the 12th round or beyond feels right for next year, but don't let him be your first 1B. He's not going to save fantasy managers two years in a row.",,2024

Dansby Swanson took the step back everyone expected in 2023 after signing his massive free-agent contract with the Cubs. His power numbers held steady, hitting 22 home runs, but his batting average dropped to .244. He scored 81 runs and knocked in 80, though his nine stolen bases were disappointing.

Evan Phillips appeared in 62 games for the Dodgers in 2023. He struck out 66 in 61 1/3 innings and finished with a sparkling 2.05 ERA and 0.83 WHIP. While his xFIP of 3.37 suggests he benefited from some luck, his 28.2 K% also says he is good in his role.

The good news for Tim Anderson is that it almost assuredly cannot get worse. In his age-30 season, across 123 games, Anderson set career lows in home runs (1), RBI (25), and ISO (.051). He had the eighth-lowest oWAR (-0.4) among batters who played over 100 games. He could bounce back in 2024, but his underlying metrics do not suggest he belongs on rosters in traditional 5x5, 12-team leagues. Hard pass.",FA,2024
