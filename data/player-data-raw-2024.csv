Andres Munoz started 2023 in a ""closer by duo"" situation with Paul Sewald, but he should have the ninth inning to himself in 2024. He dealt with some injuries last season, which limited him to only 52 game appearances. Instead of the lights-out reliever we saw in 2022, fantasy managers dealt with a decrease in K% and massive increase in BB%. The good news is that he still has an elite Whiff% (39.4) and induces ground balls at a 59-percent rate. Munoz should rack up 25 saves with a K/9 around 12.0. He is a solid Tier 2 RP in 2024.",159.0
